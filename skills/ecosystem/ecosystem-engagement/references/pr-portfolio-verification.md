# PR Portfolio Verification — Jul 22, 2026 Session

## Context
Audited the GenTech PR portfolio at `${VAULT_DIR}/10-Labs/pr-portfolio.md`. The portfolio had a Jul 20 audit note warning that all PRs from the Jul 19 run were never actually created. Verified all 10 PRs + 9 GentechLabs forks + 2 "Already listed" claims.

## Method
- `gh pr view` blocked by GitHub API rate limit (5,000-point/hour GraphQL exhausted)
- Switched to `web_extract` for direct HTTP verification — no rate limit on unauthenticated page views
- Checked each PR URL, each fork URL, and raw README files

## Results

### All 10 PRs — 404 (never created)
| # | Repo | PR# | Status |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | caramaschiHG/awesome-ai-agents-2026 | #443 | 404 |
| 2 | ahmet/awesome-web3 | #733 | 404 |
| 3 | 0xNyk/awesome-agent-cortex | #43 | 404 |
| 4 | 0xNyk/awesome-agent-cortex | #44 | 404 |
| 5 | sudeepb02/awesome-erc8004 | #82 | 404 |
| 6 | VaitaR/awesome-web3-services | #1 | 404 |
| 7 | Scottcjn/awesome-agents | #40 | 404 |
| 8 | x402-foundation/x402 | #2905 | 404 |
| 9 | solana-foundation/pay-skills | #154 | 404 |
| 10 | coinbase/agentkit | #1375 | 404 |

### All 9 GentechLabs Forks — 404
x402, pay-skills, awesome-ai-agents-2026, awesome-web3, awesome-agent-cortex, awesome-erc8004, awesome-web3-services, awesome-agents, agentkit — all 404.

### "Already Listed" Claims
- **xpaysh/awesome-x402** — ✅ CONFIRMED. GenTech Labs found at line 866 of README under "Production Implementations" with full description.
- **sudeepb02/awesome-erc8004** — ❌ NOT FOUND. No "GenTech" or "gentechlabs" mention anywhere. The Avalanche registry address is mentioned in a deployment table but not attributed to GenTech by name.

## Key Takeaways
1. PR portfolio entries with PR numbers are aspirational placeholders, not real PRs
2. Forks were either never created or were deleted after failed PR attempts
3. "Already listed" claims must be verified against the actual upstream README
4. `web_extract` is the preferred verification method — bypasses GitHub API rate limits
5. The only confirmed successful ecosystem listing is awesome-x402
