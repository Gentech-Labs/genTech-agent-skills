# Vanito Session 3 — KAGEKŌ Artists Tab Complete Build

**Date:** 2026-07-09/10
**Duration:** Long session, ~10+ hours
**Focus:** Complete build-out of KAGEKŌ Artists tab on Vanito's hub

## Summary

Full transformation of Vanito's hub Artists tab: character backstories, animated scenes, rain/lighting effects, album cover creation, song management, and theme redesign. Major concepts locked: KAGEKŌ (影光) album, character story, animated visual pipeline.

## Key Decisions Locked This Session

### Album Art
- **Album name:** KAGEKŌ (影光) — Shadow & Light
- **Final cover:** Split composition (KAGE left dark red, HIKARI right gold, jagged fire divide)
- **Animated version:** 5s looping MP4 with pulsing sun and floating embers ($1.27 via Seedance 2.0 Fast)
- **Banner art:** Original text-overlay version for top of tab, also animated
- **Style:** Gritty digital painting, dark crimson/charcoal/amber, no anime — cinematic

### Character Profiles
- **KAGE's song:** BLOOD MOON (post-hardcore screaming) — user-provided audio
- **HIKARI's song:** FIGHT FOREVER NEVER QUIT (initially MIRAI E HASHIRE, swapped per user request)
- **Together song:** IN THE DARKNESS WE RISE
- **3 original HIKARI songs written:** KIZUNA, HIKARI NO YOUNI, MIRAI E HASHIRE (saved to vault, not on hub yet)
- **Profile pics:** Animated looping videos (xAI Grok, $0.26 each), enlarged to 140×140

### Theme Direction (Forge TODO)
- **Header:** Changed from orange/gold to black/dark red gradient
- **CSS vars:** --gold→#8a1a1a, --fire→#cc2222, --magma→#4a0a0a
- **No subtitle:** Removed "Wyvern · Warrior of GenTech" — header just says "Vanito's Hub"
- **Pending:** Full theme redesign to match KAGEKŌ album cover aesthetic (dark crimson, bone white, charcoal black)

## Story — KAGEKŌ Full Narrative

Full 5-part story saved to vault at `Travels/music/kageko-story.txt`:
- Part I: The Boy Who Screamed at the Moon (KAGE origin)
- Part II: The Girl Who Sang to the Stars (HIKARI origin)
- Part III: The First Song (RISING SUN)
- Part IV: The Journey
- Part V: KAGEKŌ Epilogue (rooftop scene, "Now it feels warm")

Story embedded on hub under Artists tab as a dedicated section between character bios and album.

## Scene Animation Pipeline (Completed)

1. Generated 2 story scene images (live house meeting + rooftop epilogue) via text-to-image
2. User wanted them to match album cover style → used blockrun_image edit mode with album cover as source
3. User said "no glowing around characters" → regenerated from scratch via text-to-image
4. Animated both scenes via xAI Grok video ($0.26 each)
5. User sent rooftop MP4 clip directly → saved and embedded in story section

## Rain/Lighting Effects

### Rain (Canvas-based, live on hub)
- `<canvas id="rain-canvas">` with 150+ drops, random wind/speed/thickness
- Splash particles on bottom impact (fading circles)
- Wet glass sheen overlay on all cards via `::after` with linear-gradient
- `pointer-events: none` on canvas layer
- Runs continuously on page load

### Lighting (CSS, live on hub)
- Pulse glow on banner video (selector must target `<video>` not `<img>`)
- Border glow on KAGE/HIKARI cards
- Text pulse on KAGEKŌ title
- Light sweep across album card
- Floating ember particles
- Fade-slide-up entrance animation

## Key Technical Learnings

### Video Delivery
- GitHub Pages has 30-60s deployment delay for new MP4s
- Use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentech-Labs/gentechlabs.github.io/main/...` for instant delivery
- Always include `poster` attribute with fallback PNG

### Gitignore Ordering
```gitignore
# CORRECT order:
**/*.mp4
!music/vanito/*.mp4   # exception must come AFTER the deny
```

### CSS Selectors for Videos
- `#tab-characters > img:first-child` broke when banner changed to `<video>`
- Must use: `#tab-characters > img:first-child, #tab-characters > video:first-child`
- Same fix for `.card-together img` → `.card-together img, .card-together video`

### xAI Grok Video
- No real-person detection (unlike Seedance)
- 5s clips, $0.26 each
- Good for character portrait animation
- No lip-sync capability

### Seedance Restrictions
- Rejects images with "real person detected" error on AI-generated faces too
- Use xAI Grok as fallback
- Text-to-video (no seed image) also an option

### Character Voice Preference
- Vanito refers to KAGE as "Cajun" and HIKARI as "Hickory" sometimes
- He spells it casually — no need to correct him
- Uses nickname patterns: "Jentak", "Gentak", "Jetsa", "Jets", "Insect" for the agent

### Forge Handoff Pattern
- Save structured .md files under `01-HANDOFFS/gentech-to-forge/`
- Include specific tasks with checklists, file paths, design references
- Push to gentech-vault so Forge can read from there
- Include both what's been done and what still needs work

## Unresolved / Forge-Bound Items

1. **Rain effect improvement** — needs to look more watery, droplets on card surfaces, drip effects
2. **Lighting effects audit** — verify all animations fire on tab switch
3. **Full theme redesign** — match KAGEKŌ album aesthetic (dark crimson, bone white, charcoal black)
4. **Full site audit** — check audio players, videos, tabs, mobile performance
5. **Wav2Lip setup** — for future lip-sync music video experiments ($25-50 for 4min)
