# GenTech Family Hub Management

Managing multiple family members' hubs, dashboards, and intelligence systems with strict data isolation and automatic synchronization.

## Core Principle

**Rule:** Each family member is a separate entity with isolated data, dashboards, and intelligence. Never mix data between family members in jobs, dashboards, or reports.

## Family Member Registry

### Jordan (ProtoJay4789)
- **Steam ID:** `76561197996487689`
- **Hub URL:** `https://gentechlabs.net/jordan.html`
- **Profile:** `https://gentechlabs.net/portfolio/`
- **Cronjobs:**
  - `[Jordan] GenTech Shop — Game Release Intelligence` (41f8e6d0e24b) — 2:00 PM
  - `[Jordan] GenTech Shop — Weekly Sales Sweep` (80fd54684d86) — Wed 12:00 PM
- **Group:** HQ, Treasury, Labs, Entertainment

### Vanito
- **Steam ID:** `76561198132811363`
- **Hub URL:** `https://gentechlabs.net/vanito.html`
- **Music Vault:** `https://gentechlabs.net/vanito.html#tab-music`
- **Cronjobs:**
  - `[Vanito] GenTech Shop — Game Release Intelligence` (e28c895e6a11) — 3:00 PM
  - `[Vanito] GenTech Shop — Weekly Sales Sweep` (1c25463fc281) — Wed 12:00 PM
  - `vanito-music-sync` (f3e90d867b9c) — Every 6 hours
- **Group:** Entertainment

## Hub Architecture Pattern

### VPS Deployment (Current) — Not GitHub Pages

**Change as of Jul 2026:** Personal hubs are served from the VPS (`/var/www/gentechlabs/`) as flat HTML files behind nginx. The old GitHub Pages approach is legacy.

**Hub URLs — `<name>` matches the flat HTML file:**
- Jordan: `https://gentechlabs.net/jordan.html`
- Vanito: `https://gentechlabs.net/vanito.html`
- Main landing: `https://gentechlabs.net/` (serves hub.html)

### Hub Tab Design — Lifestyle over Business

**Rule (user preference):** Personal hubs use **lifestyle/topic tabs**, not business/metric tabs. Vanito set the pattern first (Characters, Music, Deals). Jordan confirmed when he rejected Overview/Build/Portfolio/Links in favor of Travel, POE2, Gaming, Shop tabs.

**Correct tab categories per person:**

| Person | Tabs | Vibe |
|--------|------|------|
| **Jordan** | ✈️ Travel, ⚔️ POE2, 🎮 Gaming, 🛒 GenTech Shop | Lifestyle + gaming |
| **Vanito** | 🎭 Characters, 🎵 Music, 🕹️ Deals, 🛒 Shop | Creative + deals |

**Do NOT use:** Overview, Build, Portfolio, Links, Metrics, Dashboard — those belong on landing pages, not personal hubs.

### Deploying a Hub

```bash
# Edit whichever copy is NEWEST (see below — it is not always the repo)
nano <newest-copy>

# Deploy to VPS (this is what nginx actually serves)
sudo cp <newest-copy> /var/www/gentechlabs/<name>.html
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/gentechlabs/<name>.html

# Verify
curl -s https://gentechlabs.net/<name>.html | grep "<title>"
```

**Rule: CHECK which copy is newest before editing — do not assume the repo is the source of truth.**
Several copies of each hub exist and they drift. A stale copy editing session silently reverts
live work: `/root/portfolio/Profiles/jordan.html` was ~4KB OLDER than the served
`/var/www/gentechlabs/jordan.html`, so patching the "source" copy and redeploying would have thrown
away tabs that were already live. Compare size and mtime across every candidate
(`/var/www/gentechlabs/`, the repo, any per-profile dir), edit the newest, then refresh the others
so nobody re-deploys the old one over your change.

└── index.html                     # Portfolio (Jordan's professional face)
```

**Key rules:**
- Root `/index.html` = Jordan's professional portfolio. Not a hub. Stays static.
- `/Jordan/` = Jordan's personal hub with product links and dashboards.
- `/Vanito/` = Vanito's personal hub with his projects, music, gaming.
- **No generic `/Hub/`** — only personal hubs. If one exists, redirect to Jordan.
- Every glass-accessible page needs DPAD focus management (see below).

### Dashboard Navigation Pattern

**Rule:** Every specialized dashboard MUST have a back link to the person's main hub.

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- In header section -->
<a href="/hub-vanito.html" class="back-link">← Back to Main Hub</a>

<!-- CSS for styling -->
.back-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  text-decoration: none;
  font-size: 0.9em;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 5px;
  transition: color 0.2s;
}
.back-link:hover {
  color: white;
}
```

**Navigation Flow:**
1. Main Hub (`hub-vanito.html`) → Music Dashboard (`Gaming/vanito-music-dashboard.html`)
2. Music Dashboard → Main Hub (back link)
3. Both display data from the same source (`hub-vanito-data.json`)

### Per-Person Data Hubs — isolate STRUCTURALLY, not by convention

When each person needs a dashboard over **their own live data** (their wallet, their LP position,
their portfolio), give each person a **separate page AND a separate data file**, with the person's
name **hardcoded into the page** at build time.

```
<person>-<thing>.html          # name baked in
<thing>-data-<person>.json     # one file per person
```

- **No `?person=` URL parameter, no shared `{people: [...]}` array, no `default` branch in the
  fetch.** With a parameter or a shared array, ONE rendering bug — an undefined index, a bad
  default, a loop variable captured wrong — shows person A person B's money under A's name. With
  the name baked in, the page physically cannot load another person's file.
- **Generate from one template, substitute at BUILD time** (`__TENANT__` / `__NAME__` placeholders),
  never at render time.
- **Value each person in their OWN process** — `subprocess` with that person's env vars. A single
  shared valuation module resolves its wallet at IMPORT time, so one in-process loop silently
  values everyone with the first person's wallet.
- **Prove the isolation with a grep, not with intent**: each generated page must reference exactly
  one data file, and each data file must contain only its own person's identifiers.

**Serve honest failure — never stale numbers.** A data-driven page must render an explicit error
when its fetch fails (`Could not load position data — not showing stale numbers`). A page that
quietly falls back to hardcoded values is visually identical to a working one, so the failure goes
unnoticed for weeks.

**A back-link must be CHECKED, not assumed.** A person without a hub page yet gets a back-link to a
404 from their own dashboard. HEAD-check `<person>.html` at build time and fall back to the landing
page; then curl every generated back-link and confirm it returns 200.

**Keep it fresh by riding an EXISTING cron slot, not a new one.** Fold the data refresh into a job
that already runs against the same people at a useful cadence — and make it **silent on success**
(the page renders its own "updated" timestamp, so a refresh that worked is not news). Make the
refresh **best-effort**: a hub refresh failure must never break the report a human actually reads.
Verify freshness by reading the data file's own timestamp immediately after a run — if it is not
seconds old, the refresh did not happen.

### Verifying JSON served next to a page: use a BROWSER user agent

An nginx rule can block a bare `curl` / `python-urllib` request for a `.json` file while the page's
own `fetch()` works perfectly — because the browser sends a real user agent and a Referer. A model
that tests with `urllib` sees a 403 and "fixes" a page that was never broken.

```bash
UA="Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 17_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -A "$UA" \
  -H "Referer: https://gentechlabs.net/DeFi/<person>-defi.html" \
  https://gentechlabs.net/DeFi/<thing>-data-<person>.json
```

Test the JSON the way the page will fetch it, and assert the HTTP code — a 200 page with a 403 data
file renders as an error box in the browser.

### DPAD Focus Management for Glass-Accessible Hub Pages

**Rule:** Any hub page served to Meta Ray-Ban glasses needs explicit DPAD (arrow key) focus management. The glasses webview only navigates via arrow keys + Enter — mouse clicks and standard tab order are not reliable.

**Pattern — Linear grid (hub launchpads):**
```javascript
let currentIdx = 0;
function getFocusables() {
  return [...document.querySelectorAll('.focusable')].filter(el => el.offsetParent !== null);
}
function setFocus(idx) {
  const items = getFocusables();
  if (idx < 0) idx = items.length - 1;
  if (idx >= items.length) idx = 0;
  currentIdx = idx;
  items.forEach((el, i) => el.classList.toggle('focused', i === idx));
  if (items[idx]) items[idx].focus({ preventScroll: true });
}
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  const dir = { ArrowUp:'up', ArrowDown:'down', ArrowLeft:'left', ArrowRight:'right' }[e.key];
  if (dir === 'down' || dir === 'right') { e.preventDefault(); setFocus(currentIdx + 1); }
  else if (dir === 'up' || dir === 'left') { e.preventDefault(); setFocus(currentIdx - 1); }
  else if (e.key === 'Enter') {
    const items = getFocusables();
    if (items[currentIdx]) items[currentIdx].click();
  }
}, true);
window.addEventListener('load', () => setFocus(0));
```

**Key rules:**
- Use `capture` phase (`, true` as third arg to addEventListener) to intercept before the webview's default handler
- Add `.focusable` CSS class with `:focus` and `.focused` pseudo-selectors — use a bright accent color (`#00d4ff` or `#3b82f6`) for the outline ring
- Every navigable element gets `class="focusable"` — nav links, cards, buttons
- `element.focus({ preventScroll: true })` prevents the glasses from scrolling unexpectedly
- Native `<a href>` tags handle the Enter/click via JS calling `items[currentIdx].click()`
- Also add a click event listener for desktop/phone testing (the glasses ignore it, desktop needs it)

### Link Format for Telegram Sharing

**Rule:** When sharing hub links in Telegram, use plain text, clickable, own line, label then URL.

**Format:**
```
Label
https://the-url.com
```

**Example:**
```
Jordan's Hub
https://gentechlabs.net/jordan.html
```

**Explicitly do NOT use:**
- Markdown or HTML formatting around links
- Inline links like `[text](url)`
- Bullet points with links embedded
- Multiple links on one line
- Code blocks around URLs

## Data Loading Pattern

### Static HTML + Dynamic JSON

**Rule:** Hub HTML files are static templates. Data loads dynamically from JSON via JavaScript.

**Pattern:**
```html
<!-- In HTML body -->
<div id="music-list">
  <!-- Songs will be loaded here dynamically -->
</div>

<!-- JavaScript -->
<script>
  async function loadMusic() {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('hub-vanito-data.json');
      const data = await response.json();

      const musicList = document.getElementById('music-list');
      if (!data.music || !data.music.songs || data.music.songs.length === 0) {
        musicList.innerHTML = '<div class="placeholder">No songs yet!</div>';
        return;
      }

      const songsHtml = data.music.songs.map((song, index) => `
        <div class="song-card">
          <div class="song-icon">${index + 1}</div>
          <div class="song-info">
            <div class="song-title">${song.title}</div>
            <div class="song-style">${song.style}</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      `).join('');

      musicList.innerHTML = songsHtml;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error loading music:', error);
    }
  }

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', loadMusic);
</script>
```

**Pitfall:** Hardcoded placeholder data in HTML that never updates.
**Fix:** Use JavaScript to fetch from JSON and render dynamically.

## Cronjob Data Isolation

### Person-Level Cronjob Pattern

**Rule:** Every cronjob that deals with personal data MUST have explicit person identification in the prompt.

**Pattern:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Explicit person identification
prompt = """
You are Gentech delivering Jordan's Game Release Intelligence.

Steam ID: 76561197996487689
Fetch wishlist from: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996487689/wishlist
"""

# ❌ WRONG - No person identification
prompt = """
You are Gentech delivering Game Release Intelligence.
Fetch the Steam wishlist.
"""
```

### Cronjob Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `[Person] GenTech Shop — Function Name`

**Examples:**
- `[Jordan] GenTech Shop — Game Release Intelligence`
- `[Vanito] GenTech Shop — Game Release Intelligence`
- `[Jordan] GenTech Shop — Weekly Sales Sweep`
- `[Vanito] GenTech Shop — Weekly Sales Sweep`

### Cronjob Schedule Coordination

**Rule:** Multiple cronjobs serving different people should be staggered to avoid API rate limits and message congestion.

**Staggering Pattern:**
| Time | Person | Job |
|------|--------|-----|
| 2:00 PM | Jordan | Game Release Intelligence |
| 2:30 PM | Jordan | Voice Patch Notes |
| 3:00 PM | Vanito | Game Release Intelligence |
| 3:30 PM | Vanito | Voice Patch Notes |

**Benefits:**
- No API rate limit clashes
- Messages spaced out for readability
- Clear separation between family member intelligence

**Cronjob Update Pattern:**
```bash
# Update Vanito's game intel to 3:00 PM (from 2:00 PM)
cronjob action=update job_id=e28c895e6a11 schedule="0 15 * * *"

# Update Vanito's voice notes to 3:30 PM (from 2:00 PM)
cronjob action=update job_id=a564b3353770 schedule="30 15 * * *"
```

## Sync Workflows

### Music Sync Pattern

**Architecture:**
1. User edits JSON data file locally
2. Sync script runs every 6 hours
3. Script commits changes to git
4. GitHub Pages deploys automatically
5. All dashboards show updated data

**Implementation:**
```python
# Sync script: /root/my-music/vanito-music-sync.py
HUB_DATA_FILE = "/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io/hub-vanito-data.json"
GITHUB_MUSIC_JSON = "/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io/Gaming/vanito-music.json"

# Read from local hub JSON
with open(HUB_DATA_FILE, 'r') as f:
    hub_data = json.load(f)

# Update GitHub music JSON
github_data = {
    "player": "Vanito",
    "music": {
        "totalSongs": len(hub_data['music']['songs']),
        "lastUpdated": datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    },
    "songs": hub_data['music']['songs']
}

# Write and commit
with open(GITHUB_MUSIC_JSON, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(github_data, f, indent=2)

subprocess.run(['git', 'add', 'Gaming/vanito-music.json', 'hub-vanito-data.json'], cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io')
subprocess.run(['git', 'commit', '-m', f"music(vanito): sync from hub - {len(github_data['songs'])} songs"], cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io')
subprocess.run(['git', 'push'], cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io')
```

**Cronjob:**
```python
cronjob action=create \
  name="vanito-music-sync" \
  schedule="every 360m" \
  prompt="Run Vanito music sync script to fetch songs from GenTech Hub and sync to GitHub.\n\nScript location: /root/my-music/vanito-music-sync.py" \
  no_agent=True \
  script="vanito-music-sync.py"
```

### GitHub Pages Deployment

**Pattern:**
1. Commit changes to GitHub
2. GitHub Pages automatically builds (30s delay)
3. Verify deployment
4. Share URL

**Verification Pattern:**
```bash
# Commit and push
cd /root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io
git add Gaming/vanito-music-dashboard.html hub-vanito.html hub-vanito-data.json
git commit -m "feat: add music sync for Vanito's hub"
git push

# Wait for deployment
sleep 30

# Verify
curl -s "https://protojay4789.github.io/Gaming/vanito-music-dashboard.html" | grep "Vanito"
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Wrong Steam ID in Game Intelligence

**Problem:** User gets news for wrong family member's wishlist.

**Example:** Jordan received Vanito's game intelligence because cronjob used Vanito's Steam ID.

**Fix:** Explicit Steam ID in cronjob prompt:
```python
prompt = """
You are Gentech delivering Jordan's GenTech Game News — personalized game release intelligence for JORDAN (ProtoJay4789), not Vanito.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is for JORDAN's wishlist (Steam ID: 76561197996487689), NOT Vanito's (76561198132811363).

Fetch Jordan's Steam wishlist: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996487689/wishlist
"""
```

### Pitfall 2: Cronjob Schedule Overlap

**Problem:** Multiple cronjobs hit APIs at same time, causing rate limits.

**Example:** 4 game intelligence jobs all at 2 PM daily.

**Fix:** Stagger jobs by 30 minutes:
```bash
# Jordan game intel: 2:00 PM (unchanged)
# Jordan voice notes: 2:30 PM
cronjob action=update job_id=90e51510349c schedule="30 14 * * *"

# Vanito game intel: 3:00 PM
cronjob action=update job_id=e28c895e6a11 schedule="0 15 * * *"

# Vanito voice notes: 3:30 PM
cronjob action=update job_id=a564b3353770 schedule="30 15 * * *"
```

### Pitfall 3: Static HTML with Hardcoded Data

**Problem:** Dashboard shows old data because HTML is hardcoded.

**Example:** Vanito's music hub showed "No songs yet!" even though JSON had 2 songs.

**Fix:** Use JavaScript to fetch JSON dynamically:
```javascript
async function loadMusic() {
  const response = await fetch('hub-vanito-data.json');
  const data = await response.json();
  // Render songs from data.music.songs
}
```

### Pitfall 4: Missing Back Navigation

**Problem:** User stuck in specialized dashboard, no way back to main hub.

**Fix:** Add back link in header with absolute positioning.

### Pitfall 5: Sync Script Not Committing Data File

**Problem:** Data file changes not pushed to GitHub, dashboards show old data.

**Fix:** Include data file in git add:
```python
subprocess.run(['git', 'add', 'Gaming/vanito-music.json', 'hub-vanito-data.json'], cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io')
```

### Pitfall 6: Hardcoded HTML Data Instead of Dynamic Loading (`Gaming/poe2-jordan.html`) showed Level 28 even though `poe2-jordan-monk.json` had Level 31 because HTML had hardcoded `const characters = { "monk-jordan": { level: 28, ... } }` instead of fetching from JSON.

**User Signal:** When user says "updates aren't being pushed" or "it looks like updates aren't working", check if HTML is hardcoded vs dynamic.

**Fix:** Use JavaScript to fetch JSON dynamically and render:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Dynamic loading
let characterData = null;

async function loadCharacterData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('poe2-jordan-monk.json');
    characterData = await response.json();
    renderCharacters();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load character data:', error);
    // Fallback to hardcoded data if JSON fails
    characterData = { /* fallback data */ };
    renderCharacters();
  }
}

function renderCharacters() {
  const grid = document.getElementById('character-grid');
  grid.innerHTML = '';

  const charInfo = characterData.character;
  const skills = characterData.skills;

  grid.innerHTML = `
    <h3>${charInfo.alias}</h3>
    <div class="class">${charInfo.class} — ${charInfo.ascendancy}</div>
    <div class="level">Level ${charInfo.level} • ${charInfo.act}</div>
    <!-- Render skills dynamically -->
  `;
}

// Initialize
loadCharacterData();

// ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded data (never updates)
const characters = {
  "monk-jordan": {
    alias: "Lightning Monk",
    level: 28,
    act: "Act 2"
    // This data is frozen at commit time
  }
};
renderCharacters();
```

**Diagnostic Pattern:** When user reports stale data:
1. Check if JSON file is updated (read file, check `lastUpdated` field)
2. Check if HTML has `fetch()` call for that JSON
3. If HTML has hardcoded data structure, rewrite to dynamic loading
4. Test by updating JSON and verifying dashboard reflects changes

### Audio Upload Workflow — User-Sung Songs

**Rule:** When a family member sends MP3 audio recordings of themselves singing original songs, the workflow is: transcribe → extract metadata → name files correctly → add to hub → push.

**Full Workflow:**

```
1. TRANSCRIBE — Whisper the audio to get lyrics
   whisper --model base --language en "<path>" 2>/dev/null

2. EXTRACT TITLE — Read ID3 metadata for the REAL song title
   ffprobe -v quiet -show_entries format_tags "<path>"
   → TAG:title=Fight Forever Never Quit  (this is the real title)

3. COPY TO HUB — Place in a dedicated directory
   mkdir -p /root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io/music/<person>/
   cp <audio_path> /root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io/music/<person>/<kebabed-title>.mp3

4. CHECK GITIGNORE — The repo likely blocks **/*.mp3
   Add an exception BEFORE the **/*.mp3 rule:
     **/*.mp3
     !music/<person>/*.mp3   ← add this

5. UPDATE DATA JSON — Add song entry with exact title from metadata
   hub-<person>-data.json → music.songs array

6. COMMIT & PUSH
   git add -A
   git commit -m "..."
   git push

7. SAVE LYRICS — Also save transcribed lyrics to vault
   ${VAULT_DIR}/Travels/music/<person>-<kebabed-title>.txt
```

**Key gotchas:**
- Always check ID3 tags (`ffprobe -v quiet -show_entries format_tags`) — Telegram renames files to `audio_xxx.mp3`, the REAL title is inside the metadata
- The `.gitignore` almost certainly blocks `**/*.mp3` — add a `!music/<person>/*.mp3` exception before the wildcard rule
- Some people use Japanese Romaji titles (e.g. "Mirai e Hashire") — preserve the exact form from metadata
- After pushing, wait ~30s for GitHub Pages deployment

### Music Vault Page Pattern

When building a music vault index page with inline audio players:

```html
<!-- music/<person>/index.html -->
<h1>🎧 Person's Music Vault</h1>
<div class="track-list">
  <div class="track">
    <div class="num">01</div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">Fight Forever Never Quit</div>
      <div class="ext">.mp3</div>
    </div>
    <audio controls src="fight-forever-never-quit.mp3"></audio>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Workflow:**
1. Hardcode each track's filename and title (music vaults are small — usually 3-10 tracks)
2. Use `<audio controls>` element for native browser playback (works in glasses webview if audio is supported)
3. Link back to the person's hub: `<a href="../Vanito/">← Vanito's Hub</a>`
4. Place MP3 files in the same directory as index.html
5. `.gitignore` must have a `!music/<person>/*.mp3` exception before the catch-all `**/*.mp3` rule

### Character Bio Page Pattern

**Rule:** When a family member creates named characters/artists, add a dedicated tab section with their bios, images, and backstories.

**Bottom Nav button:**
```html
<button class="nav-item" data-tab="characters" onclick="switchTab('characters')">
  <span class="icon">🎭</span>
  <span>Artists</span>
</button>
```

**Tab content structure:**
```html
<div id="tab-characters" class="tab-content">
  <!-- Hero banner image (editable version without text overlay) -->
  <!-- Section title -->
  <!-- Individual character cards with portrait image + bio + tags -->
  <!-- Together/"how they met" card for duo characters -->
</div>
```

**Character card layout (compact bio + native audio player):**
```html
<div class="card card-kage" style="padding:16px; margin-bottom:16px;">
  <div style="display:flex; gap:12px;">
    <img src="..." style="width:100px; height:100px; object-fit:cover; border-radius:8px; border:2px solid #cc2222; flex-shrink:0; cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('kage-player').play()">

**Dynamic Header Swapping Pattern:**
When switching to the characters/artists tab, swap the main page header to show the album/character art instead of the default branded header.

```css
/* CSS classes needed */
#page-header.normal-header {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--gold) 0%, var(--fire) 50%, var(--magma) 100%);
  padding: 32px 20px 28px;
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

#page-header.characters-header {
  padding: 0;
  background: none;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
  border-radius: 0 0 12px 12px;
}

#page-header.characters-header img {
  width: 100%;
  display: block;
  border-radius: 0 0 12px 12px;
}

#page-header.characters-header .settings-btn {
  z-index: 3;
}
```

```javascript
// JS in switchTab function
function switchTab(tab) {
  document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content').forEach(s => s.classList.remove('active'));
  document.querySelectorAll('.nav-item').forEach(b => b.classList.remove('active'));
  const section = document.getElementById('tab-' + tab);
  const btn = document.querySelector('.nav-item[data-tab="' + tab + '"]');
  if (section) section.classList.add('active');
  if (btn) btn.classList.add('active');
  window.scrollTo(0, 0);

  // Dynamic header swap
  const header = document.getElementById('page-header');
  if (tab === 'characters') {
    header.className = 'characters-header';
    header.innerHTML = `
      <img src="music/vanito/kage-hikari-album-cover.png" alt="KAGEKŌ">
      <button class="settings-btn" onclick="openSettings()" title="Settings">⚙️</button>
    `;
  } else {
    header.className = 'header normal-header';  // ⚠️ MUST keep .header class
    header.innerHTML = `
      <h1>⚔️ Person's Hub</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">Tagline here</div>
      <button class="settings-btn" onclick="openSettings()" title="Settings">⚙️</button>
    `;
  }
}
```

**PITFALL — CSS class stripping on header swap:**
When using `header.innerHTML` to swap content, the old .header CSS class is lost if you don't include it in the new className. The original header HTML had `class="header"` which applied gradient background, padding, and ::before shimmer via CSS. If you switch to `header.className = 'normal-header'` without including 'header', all those styles vanish and the header becomes invisible on all tabs. Always set `className = 'header normal-header'` for the normal state.

**PITFALL — inline event handlers on innerHTML:**
When using `header.innerHTML = \`...\``, ALL inline event handlers (`onclick=...`) need to be re-assigned in the HTML string. Any event listeners attached via `addEventListener` on child elements of the old innerHTML are lost. Settings button, modal toggles, etc. must have their onclick inline.

**Tab-level theming to match album artwork:**
The entire characters tab can be independently styled to match the album's aesthetic:

```css
#tab-characters {
  background: #0d0d0d;
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 16px;
  margin-top: -8px;
}

#tab-characters .card {
  background: linear-gradient(145deg, #1a0a0a 0%, #0d0d0d 100%);
  border: 1px solid #3d1a1a;
  border-radius: 12px;
}

#tab-characters .card-kage {
  border-left: 3px solid #cc2222;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(200, 30, 30, 0.1);
}

#tab-characters .card-hikari {
  border-left: 3px solid #cc3333;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(200, 50, 50, 0.1);
}

#tab-characters .card-together {
  border: 1px solid #5d2a0a;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, #1a0a0a 0%, #0d0805 100%);
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(200, 80, 20, 0.08);
}

#tab-characters .section-title {
  color: #cc3333;
}

.char-name-kage {
  font-size: 1.3rem;
  font-weight: 800;
  color: #e83030;
  text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(232, 48, 48, 0.3);
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}

.char-name-hikari {
  font-size: 1.3rem;
  font-weight: 800;
  color: #e03030;
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}

.char-subtitle {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  color: #666;
  font-style: italic;
}

.char-bio {
  margin-top: 8px;
  font-size: 0.85rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #ccc;
}

.char-tag {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 2px 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 0.7rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  letter-spacing: 0.5px;
}

.char-tag.red { background: #cc2222; color: #fff; }
.char-tag.gold { background: #cc3333; color: #fff; }
.char-tag.dark { background: #1a1a1a; color: #aaa; border: 1px solid #333; }
.char-tag.fire { background: #cc4400; color: #fff; }

.char-badge {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 4px 12px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 0.7rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}
```

**Image editing for character art (blockrun_image):**
When a user provides character images that contain text (titles, labels, lyrics), edit them to remove text:

```javascript
blockrun_image({
  action: "edit",
  image: "<local_filepath>",  // use 'image' param (NOT 'image_url')
  model: "openai/gpt-image-2",
  prompt: "Remove ALL text from this image. Remove 'X', 'Y', 'Z'... Keep ONLY the character and background.",
  size: "1024x1024"
})
```

**Prompt strategy — be exhaustive:**
- List EVERY text element to remove explicitly (titles, subtitles, Japanese characters, labels, Parental Advisory, lyrics)
- List what to KEEP: character appearance (hair style, clothing, pose, colors), background (moon, buildings, landmarks, atmosphere)
- Close with: "The image should look like the original artwork but with all text completely removed"
- Size should match source image aspect ratio

**After generation, verify:**
```bash
curl -s -o <target-path> <result-url>
vision_analyze(image="<path>", question="Is there any text remaining on this image?")
```
If residual text from background elements (neon signs, graffiti) remains, assess if it's ambient scene detail vs legible title text. Only re-run if main titles survive.

**PITFALL — .gitignore blocks new formats:** The repo likely blocks `**/*.png` or `**/*.jpg`. After saving edited images as PNG, verify with `git add` and add `!music/vanito/*.png` exceptions as needed.

**Album Cover Generation — Iterative Show-Before-Save (Vanito preference):**

1. **GENERATE** — Create image with detailed prompt referencing character designs
2. **SHOW** — Present URL in chat: "Just a look, not saved unless you say so 👀"
3. **GET FEEDBACK** — Let Vanito react ("slice it", "not anime", "make them look the same")
4. **REGENERATE** — Apply feedback (split composition, change art style)
5. **SHOW AGAIN** — Wait for explicit approval ("YESSSSSS")
6. **SAVE** — Only after explicit instruction ("put it on the hub")

**CRITICAL: Do NOT save to hub/repo until Vanito explicitly says to.** Premature saving breaks the iterative workflow. Keep generated images as references in chat only.

**Split composition technique** (when user asks for "slice" or "split" look):
- Left half: Character A with dark/crimson tones
- Right half: Character B with warm/golden tones
- Divide: Jagged crack of fire, shattered mirror, or diagonal split
- Background shared: red sun, skyline, banners, floating embers

**Native Audio Player on Character Cards:**
```html
<audio id="kage-player" controls preload="none" style="width:100%; height:36px; border-radius:4px;">
  <source src="music/vanito/song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<img src="..." onclick="document.getElementById('kage-player').play()">
```
**Telegram in-app browser restriction:** `audio.play()` via onclick often fails silently even from direct user gestures. The native `<audio controls>` play button reliably works. Do NOT use `new Audio(url).play()`. Verify MP3 content-type via `curl -sI`.

**Cache prevention for frequently updated content:**
```html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">
```
GitHub Pages has its own CDN caching — hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or private tab is most reliable.

### Animated Character Profile Pictures

**Rule:** Vanito wants character images animated as looping videos, not static PNGs.

**Workflow:**
1. Generate looping 5s video from character PNG via xAI Grok video (cheaper, less restrictive)
2. Save as `<name>-animated.mp4` in `music/vanito/`
3. Replace `<img>` with `<video autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="original.png">`
4. Increase size (Vanito found 100×100 too small — use 140×140)
5. Always include `poster` fallback for mobile browsers that don't autoplay

**Cost:** ~$0.26 per character via xAI Grok. Seedance 2.0 Fast (~$1.27) rejected for "real person detection".

**Prompt pattern:**
```
Portrait of [character description], slow subtle motion, 
[hair/feature] sways gently, [light color] light pulses softly. 
Same character designs, same composition.
```

### Canvas Rain Effect

For realistic rain that drips over content, use JavaScript canvas (not CSS):

- `<canvas id="rain-canvas">` hidden by default
- 150 drops with random speed/thickness/wind
- Splash particles on bottom impact
- `requestAnimationFrame` loop
- CSS water sheen overlay on cards via `::after`
- Always use `pointer-events: none` on canvas

**File locations:** Canvas element before `</body>`, JS engine before `</script>`, CSS in `<style>`.

### Scene Animation Pipeline

When generating story scenes to animate:

1. **Generate scene image** → show preview (don't save yet)
2. **Vanito approves** → animate via xAI Grok video (5s, $0.26)
3. **Show animated preview** → wait for approval
4. **Save MP4** to `music/vanito/` and embed in hub
5. **GitHub Pages delay** — use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentech-Labs/gentechlabs.github.io/main/...` URLs instead of relative paths

### GitHub Pages Video Delivery

**Rule:** Videos pushed to GitHub Pages have a 30-60s deployment delay. Use raw GitHub CDN for instant delivery:

```html
<video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentech-Labs/gentechlabs.github.io/main/music/vanito/file.mp4"
  autoplay loop muted playsinline>
</video>
```

### Gitignore Exception Ordering

**Rule:** gitignore rules are order-dependent — later rules override earlier ones. Always put blanket **deny first**, then `!` exceptions after:

```gitignore
# ✅ CORRECT
**/*.mp4
!music/vanito/*.mp4   # This exception works

# ❌ WRONG
!music/vanito/*.mp4   # This gets overridden
**/*.mp4               # by this
```

### MEDIA: Prefix for Telegram

When showing images/videos inline on Telegram, use the MEDIA: prefix:

```
MEDIA:/absolute/path/to/file.png
```

This renders the media directly in the chat instead of a blue hyperlink.

### Pitfall 9: Building Business Tabs Instead of Lifestyle Tabs

**Problem:** Creating a personal hub with business/metric tabs (Overview, Build, Portfolio, Links) when the user wants lifestyle/topic tabs.

**User Signal:** Jordan rejected an Overview/Build/Portfolio/Links layout and asked for Travel, POE2, Gaming, Shop instead. Vanito's hub had Characters, Music, Deals from the start.

**Fix:** Before building a personal hub, ask what the person is into — hobbies, games, travel, creative work. Map those to tabs. Business tabs belong on landing pages, not personal hubs.

**Tab archetypes by person type:**
- **Builder (Jordan):** Travel, POE2, Gaming, Shop
- **Artist (Vanito):** Characters, Music, Deals, Shop
- **Learner archetype:** Travel, Shopping, Cooking

### Pitfall 10: Deploying to Wrong Location

**Problem:** Building hub files in the GitHub Pages repo but not deploying them to the VPS.

**Fix:** Always run the deploy step after building:
```bash
cp ~/repos/gentechlabs.github.io/<name>.html /var/www/gentechlabs/<name>.html
chown www-data:www-data /var/www/gentechlabs/<name>.html
curl -s https://gentechlabs.net/<name>.html | grep "<title>"
```

**Problem:** Sync script times out or hangs when GitHub repository has divergent branches or conflicts. GitRepoLock doesn't handle all edge cases, causing script to hang indefinitely.

**Example:** Vanito music sync cronjob timed out after 60s. Investigation showed repo had divergent branches (local ahead by 2 commits, remote also moved forward). GitRepoLock's `push_with_retry()` couldn't reconcile automatically.

**User Signal:** Cronjob shows "Command timed out" or hangs without output. Terminal shows script running but never completes.

**Fix Pattern:** Add divergent branch detection and force reset before sync operations:
```python
# Add to sync script before git operations
def ensure_clean_repo_state():
    """Ensure repo is in clean state before sync"""
    import subprocess

    # Check if repo has divergent branches
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['git', 'fetch', 'origin'],
        cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io',
        capture_output=True
    )

    # Check if local is behind or divergent
    status = subprocess.run(
        ['git', 'status', '--short', '--branch'],
        cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io',
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )

    if 'diverged' in status.stdout.lower() or 'behind' in status.stdout.lower():
        print("Divergent branches detected, resetting to origin/main")
        subprocess.run(
            ['git', 'reset', '--hard', 'origin/main'],
            cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io',
            capture_output=True
        )
        return True

    return False

# Call before git operations in main()
ensure_clean_repo_state()
```

**Fallback Pattern for Manual Recovery:**
```bash
# When sync script hangs, manually recover
cd /root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io

# Stash any local changes
git stash push -m "Temporary stash for sync"

# Force reset to match remote
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Clean up untracked files
rm -f audio_*.json audio_*.srt audio_*.tsv audio_*.txt audio_*.vtt

# Run sync again
python /root/my-music/vanito-music-sync.py
```

**Timeout Configuration:**
```python
# In sync script, set appropriate timeout for git operations
# Git operations can hang, especially with network issues
GIT_TIMEOUT = 120  # 2 minutes for git fetch/push

subprocess.run(
    ['git', 'push'],
    cwd='/root/repos/gentechlabs.github.io',
    timeout=GIT_TIMEOUT,
    capture_output=True
)
```
