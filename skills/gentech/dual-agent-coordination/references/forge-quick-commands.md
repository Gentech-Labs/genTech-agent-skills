Forge: "Working on Cloudflare setup, completed: waitlist signup ✓"
Forge: "Next: Audit existing APIs"
```

### Redirect
```
You:   "Forge, switch to Agent Registration API instead"
Forge: "Switched to Agent Registration API, starting work"
```

### Blocker
```
Forge: "BLOCKED: Need API documentation"
Forge: "Added to build queue, waiting for your input"
You:   "Use mock data for now"
Forge: "Continuing with mock data approach"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Forge Not Responding
```
Check: Is Forge's Telegram running?
Fix:   Restart Forge's gateway

Check: Is vault accessible?
Fix:   Sync vault: ob sync

Check: Are there errors in assignments?
Fix:   Review 10-Labs/forge-assignments.md
```

### Progress Not Updating
```
Check: Did Forge sync vault?
Fix:   Tell Forge: "Forge, sync vault"

Check: Are you syncing your side?
Fix:   Run: cd ${VAULT_DIR} && ob sync

Check: Git conflicts?
Fix:   Resolve merge conflicts manually
```

### Unclear Blockers
```
Check: Build queue notes
Fix:   Read: cat 10-Labs/build-queue.md

Ask Forge: "Forge, what's blocking you?"
Forge: "Blocked on: Need X approval"
```
