## How to Use This Validation in Submissions

### OKX Hackathon Submission (Revenue Rocket Category)

> "Our AgentKit stack aligns with industry leaders. Travala uses x402 for payments, ERC-8004 for reputation, MCP for tools — exactly what we're building. We're not theorizing — we're standing on proven infrastructure that processes $24.24M/month in x402 volume across 94K buyers."

### Grant Applications

> "GenTech's technology choices aren't speculative — they're validated by production systems. Travala's travel MCP (hotel booking with x402 payments and ERC-8004 reputation) uses the same stack we're building. This reduces technical risk and accelerates time-to-market."

### Partnership Conversations

> "We've adopted the same infrastructure standards as Travala (x402, ERC-8004, MCP). This means our agents are immediately compatible with the broader agent economy — no custom integration work required."

## Pattern to Replicate

When you find a new ecosystem validation:

1. **Document the product** — Name, URL, launch date
2. **Map their stack** — What standards do they use?
3. **Validate our choices** — How does this prove our stack?
4. **Extract patterns** — Commission models, reputation flows, payment patterns
5. **Reference in submissions** — Hackathons, grants, partnerships
