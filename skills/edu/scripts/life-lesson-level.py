life-lesson-level.py — GenTech EDU: "how good do I actually need to be?" (the LEVEL layer).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Jordan (2026-09-24): *"I want to get my Spanish to a better speaking level before I go to somewhere like
Santo Domingo or Santiago or any of the other Dominican cities."*

That is a DIFFERENT requirement from the trip he already has priced, and our build did not cover it:

  · The engine teaches the DOMINICAN DIALECT. It had no notion of a LEVEL.
  · Sosúa (his booked trip) is a tourist town where English works. Santo Domingo/Santiago are not —
    outside the hotel desk, English thins out fast.
  · So "better speaking level" needs a TARGET, and the target is a property of the PLACE, not of the
    language. `es-DO` is the same dialect in both; the required level is not.

This script answers three questions, in this order:
  1. What level does this trip actually require?    (PACK data — `data/level-targets.json`)
  2. Roughly where is he now?                        (from OBSERVED practice, or "unmeasured")
  3. What is the honest gap, in hours and calendar?  (CEFR ladder arithmetic)

HONESTY RULES (non-negotiable — this is a self-assessment tool and the easiest place in the fleet to lie)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  · NEVER prints a CEFR level as a fact about him. Phrase-bank practice CANNOT certify a level.
    Anything derived from it is labelled ESTIMATE, and the basis is printed.
  · NO observed practice -> "unmeasured". Never a fabricated 0%, never a default "you're A1".
  · BANK COVERAGE IS NOT THE LEVEL. He can master 100% of a 19-phrase bank and still not be A1 —
    the bank is a starting set, not the level. These two numbers are reported SEPARATELY and the
    cap is stated out loud, because conflating them is how a language app lies to you.
  · Ladder hours are quoted as RANGES from cited sources, never averaged into one fake precise number.
  · An unmatched place yields NO target. Refusing to guess beats assigning a default.
