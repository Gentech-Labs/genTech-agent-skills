edu_apps.py — the app EQUIVALENCE layer.

WHY
---
Jordan (2026-09-23): *"we need a tab for apps… you got your food apps. You've got your like Kluk, for
example — I know in Southeast Asia they use Kluk the same way we use Grubhub. So now I know food
equivalence — so if I don't want to grab a moto or take an Uber somewhere, I could just have it delivered."*

WHAT HE ACTUALLY ASKED FOR
--------------------------
Not a list of app names per country. **A mapping.** He is not learning app names — he is mapping a
**need** he already understands ("I want food delivered") onto **whatever that country calls it**. That
is what makes it usable in a country he has never been to.

`FOOD DELIVERY → {US: Grubhub/DoorDash, DR: Komida, TH: Grab/LINE MAN}`

So the unit here is the **need**, not the app. "I don't want to ride there" is ONE need that resolves to
either a RIDE or a DELIVERY — and the equivalence is what tells him he has a choice.

THE HONESTY RULE
----------------
A country where the need has NO known app returns **unknown — do not assume it carries over**, never a
blank or a borrowed name. Assuming the US app works abroad is the exact error this prevents.

# ONE seat's profile, carried byte-identical into all four seats. Two things were wrong with it, and
# both were measured 2026-09-25: (1) it made every seat read HQ's copy, so a worker seat could not use
# its own data and its own copy was dead weight that went stale unnoticed; (2) it pointed at a
# DIFFERENT file than the one SKILL.md documents and `fleet_skill_drift_audit.py` polices, so the
# audit's drift gate was watching a file the code never opened. Resolved from `__file__`, the doc,
# the code and the audit all name the same file, on every seat. As of 2026-09-25 the other four
# scripts in this skill (`life-lesson-{engine,audio,level,scenario}.py`) resolve their own seat the
# same way and live in this directory too — one skill, one tree, no hardcoded profile anywhere.
