# PR Submission Rules — Hard Gate

> ⚠️ **DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP.** Every step is mandatory. Bot-rejected PRs waste reviewer time and damage our reputation.

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight — Token & Account Health Check (Mandatory — Run Before Anything)

Before ANY GitHub operation, verify the authentication token and account are valid. A dead token or missing account makes every subsequent API call waste budget and produce phantom data.

### 1. Check token validity

```bash
gh auth status 2>&1
```

**Expected:** `✓ Logged in to github.com account GentechLabs`
**Failure signals:**
- `X Failed to log in` + `The token in ... is invalid.` → Token was revoked or expired
- `HTTP 401` or `HTTP 403` on any `gh api` call → Token is dead
- `HTTP 404` on `gh api user` or `gh api users/ProtoJay4789` → Account itself may be suspended/deleted. `gh api repos/ProtoJay4789` is WRONG — that endpoint looks for a *repo* named "ProtoJay4789", not the account. Always check the user endpoint first.

### 2. Check account existence (browser verification)

When `gh auth status` fails, verify the account still exists by checking the profile page directly:

```bash
# Use browser or web_extract — bypasses API rate limits
# https://github.com/Gentech-Labs should return the profile, not 404
```

**If the account returns 404:** The account was deleted, renamed, or suspended. ALL forks, PRs, and repos are gone. Do NOT attempt any GitHub operations — they will all fail.

### 3. Check the stored token

The token lives in two places:
- `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` (used by `gh` CLI)
- `${PROFILE_DIR}/secrets/github-token` (used by scripts)

Both must contain the same valid token. If one is stale, update both.

### 4. Recovery workflow (when token is dead or account is 404)

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Token invalid, account exists | Report to Jordan. Do NOT attempt `gh auth login` — it requires interactive browser flow. |
| Account returns 404 | Report to Jordan. The entire PR portfolio is gone. Update rotation file to mark all repos as pending (they need fresh forks). |
| Token expired mid-session | Stop all GitHub operations immediately. Cached API results from before the expiry may be stale — do NOT trust them. Report the failure and the last known good state. |

**⚠️ Pitfall — Cached API results from a dead token.** The REST API may return PR data even after the token is invalidated (cached from the token's last valid state). This creates phantom PRs in tracking — PRs that appear open in the API response but return 404 when verified via browser. Always verify critical PRs via browser or `web_extract` when the token is suspect. A PR that exists only in API output but not on the web is a ghost.

**⚠️ Pitfall — `gh api repos/GentechLabs` returns 404 if no repo named "GentechLabs" exists.** This endpoint looks for a REPO, not the user account. It will always 404 if there's no repo with that exact name. To check if the account itself is active, use `gh api user` or `gh api users/GentechLabs`. Do NOT confuse a missing repo with a deleted account.

### 5. Update rotation file on failure

When the session cannot proceed due to token/account issues, update the rotation file to mark the current batch as checked (so the next run doesn't retry the same repos with the same dead token):

```bash
# Write to /root/.pr-maintainer-rotation.txt
# Set repos_checked to the current batch
# Leave repos_pending as-is
```

**⚠️ Pitfall — Rotation file propagates stale "ACCOUNT 404" across multiple runs without re-verification.** When a run writes `status: ACCOUNT 404` to the rotation file, subsequent runs read that entry and may skip re-verifying the account. The next run MUST always re-check with `curl -s -H "Authorization: token $(gh auth token)" https://api.github.com/user` — never skip the pre-flight check because the rotation file says "404." A run that skips its own account check because a prior run's entry says the account is dead will produce an empty report for that entire run. The rotation file is a *log*, not the *truth*.

### 6. False-alarm recovery — account was never actually gone

When the pre-flight account check succeeds (`/user` endpoint returns valid GentechLabs data) but the rotation file from a prior run says "ACCOUNT 404" or "account deleted/suspended":

1. **Do NOT trust the rotation file** — the account was checked with the correct endpoint this run and is alive. Override the stale status.
2. **Sample-audit known PRs** — pick 5-10 PRs from the seed list that were open in prior runs (e.g., MERGEABLE PRs from large repos). Use the REST API:
   ```bash
   for pr in "owner/repo#123" "owner2/repo2#456"; do
     repo=$(echo $pr | cut -d# -f1)
     num=$(echo $pr | cut -d# -f2)
     gh api "repos/$repo/pulls/$num" --jq '{number, state, mergeable}'
   done
   ```
   If 4+ of 5 sampled PRs return valid data, the portfolio is intact.
3. **Write a corrected rotation file entry** that documents the false alarm and resets the tracking:
   ```
   status: ACTIVE — previous "404" was false alarm (wrong endpoint or transient issue)
   repos_pending: ALL — full scan needed (portfolio may have changed while tracking was wrong)
   ```
4. **Proceed with a full inbox scan** — do NOT assume the portfolio didn't change during the false-alarm period. PRs may have been merged, commented on, or conflicted while prior runs skipped them.
5. **Add a recovery note to the run report** explaining that the prior N runs produced empty/incomplete reports due to the false alarm, so Jordan knows what coverage gap existed.

**Root cause of most false 404 alarms:** The public `/users/GentechLabs` endpoint can 404 when rate-limited by unauthenticated requests (GitHub returns 404, not 403, for rate-limited user lookups from unauthenticated contexts). `web_extract(github.com/Gentech-Labs)` from a headless VPS also 404s because GitHub rate-limits anonymous page views. The authenticated `/user` endpoint with a valid token is the only reliable check. Always use `curl -s -H "Authorization: token $(gh auth token)" https://api.github.com/user` as the primary check — fall back to `web_extract` only when the token itself is known to be dead.

## Phase 0: Inbox Duty (Mandatory — Always Run First)

Before opening ANY new PR, check our existing PRs for replies:

1. **List all open PRs from GentechLabs — REST-based inventory (preferred):**

   ⚠️ **Pitfall — `gh api search/issues` with `author:GentechLabs` returns HTTP 422.** The GitHub Search API blocks user-based queries for this account, returning `"The listed users cannot be searched either because the users do not exist or you do not have permission to view the users."` This is a persistent account-level restriction, not a transient error. Do NOT use the search API for user-based PR queries.

   **Use the REST API instead — iterate known repos and filter by author:**
   ```bash
   for repo in "owner/repo1" "owner/repo2"; do
     gh api "repos/$repo/pulls?state=open&per_page=10" --jq \
       '[.[] | select(.user.login == "GentechLabs") | {number, title, state, head: .head.ref, updated_at: .updated_at, mergeable: .mergeable}]'
   done
   ```
   Cost: 1 REST request per repo. 48 repos = 48 requests (~1% of 5,000/hr budget). Well within limits.

   **Maintain a seed list of known repos** (see "Known PR Targets" table at the end of this skill). When adding a new repo, add it to the seed list so future scans pick it up.

   **⚠️ Pitfall — `gh api repos/.../pulls` with `--raw-field` returns HTTP 422.** Using `--raw-field` (or `-f`) with the `pulls` endpoint fails because `gh api` translates `--raw-field` params into a POST body, not URL query params. The `pulls` endpoint requires URL query parameters for `state`, `per_page`, etc. Always use `?` URL params in the URL string:

   ```bash
   # ✅ CORRECT — URL query params in the URL itself
   gh api "repos/$repo/pulls?state=open&per_page=10" --jq '...'

   # ❌ WRONG — --raw-field produces a POST body, returns 422
   gh api repos/$repo/pulls --raw-field state=open --jq '...'
   ```

   Verified Jul 21 2026 across 51 repos — every `--raw-field` call returned `"Invalid request. \"base\", \"head\" weren't supplied."` while the URL-param approach worked immediately.

   **⚠️ Pitfall — REST `/pulls` endpoint is the reliable fallback when GraphQL is exhausted.** This session (Jul 22 12:30 ET) confirmed: `gh pr view` (GraphQL) returned "API rate limit already exceeded" for all 18 PRs, while `gh api repos/.../pulls` (REST) returned every PR's status successfully. The REST API has a separate budget pool from GraphQL. When GraphQL is exhausted, switch to REST-only scanning — it will still work. See the "Rate limit strategy" section below for the tiered approach.

   **⚠️ Pitfall — REST `/pulls` endpoint consumes budget faster than the 5,000/hr estimate suggests.** The 5,000/hr budget is shared across ALL `gh api` calls in the session — repo listing, user lookups, notification checks, and prior operations all consume it. On Jul 21 the 2:30pm run exhausted the REST budget after only ~10 PR-status calls, despite the estimate suggesting 48+ should be safe. The `/pulls` endpoint carries a higher per-call cost than simpler endpoints like `/repos/owner/repo`. After exhaustion, `gh api rate_limit` may still report 59 remaining — that endpoint shows a different bucket. **Prevention:** If any `gh api` calls ran earlier in the session (wake-up, vault checks, prior tasks), factor that into the PR budget. Assume ~30-40 PR-status calls per session max when the budget was partially consumed.

   ⚠️ **Pitfall — f-string `{`/`}` inside jq expressions break inside `execute_code` + `terminal()`, producing `--jq: command not found`.** When running `gh api` with `--jq` from inside an `execute_code` block, Python's f-string delimiters eat the curly braces before bash ever sees them. The jq expression `{number, title}` gets rendered as `number, title` (curlies stripped), and the shell interprets `--jq` as a separate bare-word command:

   ```python
   # ❌ BROKEN — f-string strips { } before bash sees --jq
   r = terminal(f"gh api repos/{repo}/pulls --jq '[.[] | {number, title}]'")
   # Bash sees: gh api repos/X/pulls --jq '[.[] | number, title]'
   # Python's f-string consumed the { } as placeholders, leaving '| number, title' and bare --jq
   ```

   **Fix — double the inner braces** so Python emits literal `{` / `}` characters:
   ```python
   r = terminal(f"gh api repos/{repo}/pulls --jq '[.[] | {{number, title}}]'")
   ```

   For jq filters that also contain double-quoted strings (e.g., `select(.user.login == "GentechLabs")`), escape the inner double quotes with backslash:

   ```python
   # ✅ Verified working (Jul 25 2026):
   r = terminal(f"gh api 'repos/{repo}/pulls' --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == \"GentechLabs\") | {{number, title, state, mergeable}}]'", timeout=10)
   ```

   **Simpler alternative for complex jq:** Call `gh api ... --jq '...'` directly from `terminal()` (outside `execute_code`) when the expression has nested braces — no f-string conflicts. Reserve `execute_code` for loops that need programmatic error handling or retry logic — and when you do use it, test one iteration before running the full batch.

   **Fallback — `gh pr list --head GentechLabs:`** only works inside a cloned git repo. Use the REST API above when working outside a repo (e.g., cron jobs, one-shot sessions).

2. **For each open PR, check for new comments/reviews, mergeability, AND mergeStateStatus — batch pattern (for 15+ PRs):**

   The `mergeable` field alone is insufficient. A PR can be `mergeable: MERGEABLE` (no file conflicts) but `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` (branch protection blocking merge — stale branch, missing CI checks, etc.). Always check both fields. See "Common Bot Traps" → `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` for diagnostics.

   **Bash loop** (good for <20 PRs, fast with known-good targets):
   ```bash
   for repo_pr in "owner/repo#123" "owner2/repo2#456"; do
     repo=$(echo $repo_pr | cut -d# -f1)
     num=$(echo $repo_pr | cut -d# -f2)
     echo "=== $repo#$num ==="
     gh pr view $num -R $repo --json comments,reviews,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,state,updatedAt --jq \
       '{comments: [.comments[] | {author: .author.login, body: (.body[:200] + "...")}],
         reviews: [.reviews[] | {author: .author.login, state: .state}],
         mergeable: .mergeable, mergeStateStatus: .mergeStateStatus, state: .state, updatedAt: .updatedAt}'
   done
   ```

   **Python loop** from `execute_code` (better for 50+ PRs — handles partial failures per-PR instead of crashing the whole batch):
   ```python
   from hermes_tools import terminal
   PRS = ["owner/repo#123", "owner2/repo2#456"]
   for pr in PRS:
       repo, num = pr.split("#")
       r = terminal(f"gh pr view {num} -R {repo} --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,comments,additions,deletions,updatedAt --jq '{{pr: \"{repo}#{num}\", mergeable, mergeStateStatus, comments: (.comments | length), additions, deletions, updatedAt}}'", timeout=10)
       if r.get('output', '').strip():
           print(r['output'])
       else:
           print(f'"error": "{pr}"')
   ```
   ⚠️ **Pitfall — `gh pr view` can error without raising `exit_code > 0`** (returns empty or `null` output). Always check `r.get('output', '')` for empty string, not just `exit_code`.

   ⚠️ **Pitfall — Rate limit exhaustion on 50+ PR batch scans.** Scanning 50+ PRs with individual `gh pr view` calls (GraphQL API) will exhaust the 5,000-point hourly budget mid-scan. The REST API (used by `gh api repos/...`) has a separate budget pool. See `references/rate-limit-management.md` for tiered scan strategies.

   ⚠️ **Pitfall — Combined REST + GraphQL exhaustion.** Running BOTH a REST batch scan (45+ `gh api repos/...` calls) AND a GraphQL batch scan (45+ `gh pr view` calls) in the same session can exhaust BOTH budgets. The REST API (5000/hr) seems inexhaustible but prior operations (repo listing, user lookups, notification checks) consume it, and the `/pulls` endpoint itself carries a higher per-call cost than simpler endpoints. After both are exhausted, `gh api rate_limit` may still report 59 remaining — that endpoint shows a different bucket. Do NOT trust `rate_limit` as a reliable indicator of REST availability. When ALL PRs return `mergeable: null`, you are rate-limited, not waiting for GitHub to compute mergeability. **Strategy:** if running an inbox scan and REST budget is already partially consumed (e.g., by prior `gh api` calls in the session), skip the full REST iteration and go straight to the compact tier-1 approach: check only the ~10 most recently updated repos from the seed list.

   ⚠️ **Pitfall — `mergeable: null` across ALL PRs means rate-limited, not computing.** When the REST API returns `mergeable: null` for every PR in a batch scan, this is a rate-limit signal, not a transient compute delay. GitHub returns `null` for individual PRs when the mergeability check hasn't finished computing, but when ALL 45+ PRs return null simultaneously, the API is refusing the requests. Stop the scan and fall back to the last known state from the previous run.

   ⚠️ **Re-scan fallback — ~9% of batch `gh pr view` calls return empty/null for valid PRs.**
   In batch scans of 50+ PRs, `gh pr view` returns empty or `null` output for ~5%–9% of
   entries despite the PR being OPEN and MERGEABLE. After the batch scan completes,
   immediately re-scan the erroring PRs individually to get their true status:
   ```bash
   for pr in "owner/repo#123" "owner2/repo2#456"; do
     repo=$(echo $pr | cut -d# -f1)
     num=$(echo $pr | cut -d# -f2)
     gh pr view $num -R $repo --json state,mergeable,title --jq '{state, mergeable, title}'
   done
   ```
   This individual re-scan always succeeds for valid PRs — the batch `gh pr view` has a
   transient coverage issue, not a per-PR problem. If an individual re-scan also fails,
   the PR needs investigation (closed, branch deleted, fork removed).

   - Use `gh pr view <number> -R <owner/repo> --json comments` first to get comment count, then review flagged PRs in detail
   - If a bot flagged issues (Greptile, Glama, github-actions): FIX immediately
   - If a maintainer asked a question: ANSWER it directly as a comment
   - If changes were requested: PUSH the fix, then tag the reviewer
   - After addressing, re-request review if the platform supports it
   - **Empty-body reviews are normal** — A reviewer can submit a review with `"body": ""`. This means they looked but left no specific text. Don't investigate or respond to empty-body reviews.

3. **Check GitHub notifications for unread:**
   ```bash
   gh api notifications --jq '.[] | select(.reason != "subscribed") | {title, url, reason, updated_at}'
   ```
   **Investigate each notification** by fetching the thread subject:
   ```bash
   gh api notifications/threads/<THREAD_ID> | python3 -c "
   import json,sys
   thread = json.load(sys.stdin)
   print(f'Subject: {thread[\"subject\"][\"title\"]}')
   print(f'Type: {thread[\"subject\"][\"type\"]}')
   print(f'Reason: {thread[\"reason\"]}')
   print(f'Unread: {thread.get(\"unread\",\"?\")}')
   print(f'URL: {thread[\"subject\"][\"url\"]}')
   "
   ```
   Then handle based on reason:
   - `reason: "author"` → Our own PR had activity (e.g., merged, new commit pushed, PR was updated). Check the PR status with `gh pr view`.
   - `reason: "review_requested"` → Someone asked us to review. Address it.
   - `reason: "mention"` → We were @mentioned. Respond.
   - Mark threads read after investigation: `gh api notifications/threads/<THREAD_ID> --method PATCH`

4. **Report status** before proceeding to new PR work.

## Phase 0: Evaluate — Is a PR the Right Approach?

Before forking or editing anything, ask:

1. **Does the repo have a high PR rejection rate?** Check the CONTRIBUTING.md and recent closed PRs. Repos like obra/superpowers (94% rejection rate) explicitly reject domain-specific additions — they want standalone plugins.
2. **Does the repo enforce a quality gate in CONTRIBUTING.md?**
   - Star minimums (e.g., "100+ GitHub stars") — projects below the threshold will be closed
   - Anti-spam clauses (e.g., "same submission opened across 5+ awesome lists") — with 49+ open PRs across dozens of lists, we are a prime target for this rule
   - Third-party adoption requirements ("not the sole maintainer of an unknown project")
   - AI-disclosure, no-marketing, or no-LLM-generated-content policies
   If any of these apply, the PR will be flagged or rejected before a reviewer sees it.
3. **Is your addition domain-specific?** If it only benefits a specific protocol, tool, or workflow (e.g., an x402 payment skill for a specific API), the maintainer may say "publish as a standalone plugin."
4. **Does the repo accept third-party listings?** Some repos don't list external projects at all. A separate plugin repo you control is always safer than a rejected PR.
5. **Could this work as a standalone plugin?** If yes, create a separate repo with the plugin format the target ecosystem expects. You can always PR a marketplace.json entry later after the standalone plugin has traction.

Rule of thumb: if you're adding your own project to someone else's list, a standalone plugin in their format is often better than a direct PR. Especially on repos with high rejection rates and strict maintainers.

### Quality Gate: Standard-Open-Source-Bias Repos

Some curated repos (especially 500+★) enforce a **standard-OSS-only** quality bar that explicitly rejects entries adjacent to commercial APIs. They are not anti-PR — they are anti-"thin wrapper around a paid service":

| Policy Signal | Example Wording | Impact on GenTech |
|---|---|---|
| "Commercial wrappers rejected" | "Open-source adapters for commercial APIs/services are reviewed more strictly" | Thin MCP gateways around paid APIs (BlockRun, x402) blocked |
| "No pricing in entry text" | "Free tier, no API key, pricing, credits, pay-per-call should not be in the entry line" | Pay-per-call model flagged as advertising |
| "Self-hosted value required" | "Show clear standalone OSS value without the hosted product" | Must prove OSS artifact has independent usefulness |

**Pre-flight check:** Scan CONTRIBUTING.md for phrases like "thin gateway", "commercial dependency", "open-source adapter", "no marketing", "standard OSS". If found and your entry is primarily a paid-API connector (BlockRun MCP, x402 gateway), the repo will likely reject it — log as "evaluated — quality gate" and move on rather than submitting a doomed PR.

**Known instance:** Jenqyang/Awesome-AI-Agents (1,188★, evaluated Jul 18 2026) — has a strict standard-OSS-bias policy explicitly warning about thin commercial wrappers. Skipped for this reason.

## Phase 1: Pre-Flight (Mandatory — Before Any New Edits)

### 1. Check submission method (PR vs web form)
- **First, scan the README for explicit "no PRs" statements** — Some repos (e.g., wong2/awesome-mcp-servers) say "We do not accept PRs. Please submit via our website." If found, submit via the specified web form, note the URL for Jordan, and skip all remaining PR steps.
- Check if the repo has a dedicated submission website (often linked in README or repo description)

### 2. Read CONTRIBUTING.md
- `cat CONTRIBUTING.md` or find it in the repo root / `.github/`
- Check for: description length limits, format rules, pricing/category enums, alphabetical order requirements, **star minimums** (e.g., "100+ stars"), and **anti-spam policies** (e.g., "submissions across 5+ awesome lists rejected")
- If no CONTRIBUTING.md exists, check the README top section for submission policies

### 2a. Check for AGENTS.md
Some repos include an `AGENTS.md` file with AI-agent-specific contribution
guidelines (e.g., BlockRunAI/awesome-finance-mcp has table-format rules,
60-char description caps, and valid pricing enums that differ from the
human README). Run:
  ls AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null && cat AGENTS.md
If present, its rules take precedence over the human CONTRIBUTING.md for
agent submissions — the file is written specifically for automated
contributors like this one.

### 2. Read PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- Located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` or the repo root
- Identify **exactly** what sections are required (## Description, ## Checklist, etc.)
- Note the exact header names — they must match character-for-character
- Note any checklist items and their exact syntax (`- [ ]` vs `[ ]`)

### 3. Check for existing listing
- `grep -i "gentech\|genTech\|gen_tech\|GenTech\|Gen Tech" README.md`
- If found: audit and update the existing entry instead of adding new
- If the link is stale, fix it. If the description is outdated, improve it.

### 4. Catalog-style repos: verify frontmatter ↔ OpenAPI spec sync

For repos like `solana-foundation/pay-skills` where each service has BOTH:
- A YAML frontmatter with `pricing.per_request`
- An OpenAPI spec file with `x-payment-info.price.amount`

These MUST match. If they differ (e.g., PAY.md says `$0.001` but OpenAPI says `$0.025`), agents get incorrect pricing signals and the PR gets flagged.

**Pitfall — patch can ADD alongside, not REPLACE:** When adding `parameters` blocks to an existing OpenAPI spec, `patch` may append a second `parameters` key rather than replacing the first. JSON allows duplicate keys but parsers silently keep only the last instance. After any patch to an OpenAPI JSON file, **verify no duplicate keys exist** (valid JSON alone is insufficient):

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
d = json.load(open('openapi.json'))
duds = []
for path, methods in d.get('paths', {}).items():
    for method, spec in methods.items():
        count = sum(1 for k in spec if k == 'parameters')
        if count > 1:
            duds.append(f'{path} ({method}): {count} parameters blocks')
if duds:
    print('DUPLICATE KEYS FOUND:')
    for d in duds: print(f'  ❌ {d}')
else:
    print('✅ No duplicate keys')
"
```

**Checklist for catalog entries:**
- [ ] Compare `pricing.per_request` in frontmatter against every endpoint's `x-payment-info.price.amount` in the OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Shared OpenAPI files bleed all endpoints into every service — create per-service `openapi.json` files instead, each containing only that service's endpoints
- [ ] Verify the `category` field matches the repo's CONTRIBUTING.md allowed categories (don't put shopping services in `finance`)
- [ ] Verify listed endpoints actually exist in the referenced OpenAPI file (dead listings = instant rejection)
- [ ] **Verify every paid endpoint has `parameters` defined** — Greptile flags endpoints with no parameters block. An agent cannot construct a valid request from an OpenAPI spec with missing query/path parameters. At minimum, every paid search/query endpoint needs a `q` (query, required string) parameter plus any optional filters. See `references/openapi-params-injection-pattern.md` for the full walkthrough.

**Fix pattern for shared specs:**
```bash
# Instead of a shared ../openapi.json per-service:
providers/gentech/token-security/openapi.json      # only /api/token/risk
providers/gentech/wallet-analyzer/openapi.json      # only /api/wallet/analyze
# Each PAY.md references its own: openapi:
#   path: openapi.json
```

**Fix pattern for missing parameters (add to every paid endpoint that accepts query input):**
```json
"parameters": [
  {
    "name": "q",
    "in": "query",
    "required": true,
    "schema": { "type": "string" },
    "description": "Search query"
  },
  {
    "name": "category",
    "in": "query",
    "required": false,
    "schema": { "type": "string", "enum": ["games", "movies", "all"] },
    "description": "Category filter"
  }
]
```

### 5. Check for existing PR from our fork
- `gh pr list --head GentechLabs:* --json number,title,state`
- Avoid duplicate submissions

### 6. Check CI
- What `.github/workflows/` exists? Format validators? Link checkers?
- Note any format tests (awesome-lint, markdownlint, etc.)

### 7. Verify the repo accepts PRs from forks (BEFORE forking)
- Quick check: list open PRs from all contributors:
  gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls --paginate --jq '.[].user.login'
- **⚠️ Pitfall — `gh search prs` with `repo:` qualifier can fail.** The command
  `gh search prs "repo:owner/repo is:open" --json number,author --limit 3`
  returns "resources do not exist or you do not have permission to view them"
  for some repos even when they are public and have open PRs. Use the direct
  API call above (`gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls`) instead — it is more
  reliable and does not go through the search index.
- Check if issues are enabled (fallback if PRs are restricted):
  gh api repos/owner/repo --jq '.has_issues'
- If BOTH PR creation and issues are disabled, log the repo as a target and move on.

### 8. Verify the fork is a REAL GitHub fork (not a manual repo clone)

Before attempting to create a PR, verify the fork is an actual GitHub fork:
```bash
gh api repos/Gentech-Labs/<repo-name> --jq '{fork, parent: .parent.full_name}'
```

**Expected:** `{"fork": true, "parent": "GOATNetwork/agentkit"}`

If `fork: false` or the `POST /forks` endpoint returns "You cannot fork this repository at this time," use the browser compare-link fallback. See `references/non-fork-pr-submission.md` for the full workflow — rebase onto upstream first, then submit via the browser compare URL.

### 9. Check for fork-name collision
- Before forking, check if a fork with the upstream's repo name already exists from a different upstream:
  gh repo list GentechLabs --json name,nameWithOwner --jq '.[] | select(.name == "REPO_NAME") | .nameWithOwner'
- If a matching-name fork exists from a different upstream, delete it first, or use --fork-name and be prepared for potential PR creation issues.

**⚠️ Pitfall — fork-name collision causes cryptic `gh pr create` failure.**
When a fork with the same short repo name exists from a DIFFERENT upstream, forking again with the same name returns HTTP 403 ("Name already exists on this account"). Even after deleting it and using `--fork-name`, the NEW fork gets created with a `-gentech` suffix that `gh pr create` refuses to find, returning:
```
GraphQL: Head sha can't be blank, Base sha can't be blank, No commits between UPSTREAM:main and GentechLabs:BRANCH, Head ref must be a branch (createPullRequest)
```

**Diagnose:**
```bash
# Check if your fork is actually a fork of the TARGET upstream
gh api repos/Gentech-Labs/REPO_NAME --jq '{fork, parent: .parent.full_name}'
# If parent != target upstream, you have a stale fork from the wrong source
```

**Recovery workflow (discovered Jul 19 2026 on ARUNAGIRINATHAN-K/awesome-ai-agents-2026):**
```bash
# 1. List forks by exact name to find collision
gh repo list GentechLabs --json name,nameWithOwner --limit 50 -q \
  '.[] | select(.name | startswith("REPO_NAME")) | {fork: .name, upstream: .nameWithOwner}'

# 2. Delete the WRONG fork (from different upstream)
gh api repos/Gentech-Labs/WRONG_FORK_NAME --method DELETE

# 3. Fork the TARGET repo with a unique name
gh repo fork TARGET_OWNER/REPO_NAME --fork-name REPO_NAME-unique

# 4. Clone the NEW fork (NOT from any stale directory)
gh repo clone Gentech-Labs/REPO_NAME-unique /tmp/fresh-clone

# 5. Set up upstream + sync
cd /tmp/fresh-clone
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TARGET_OWNER/REPO_NAME.git
git fetch upstream main
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push origin main --force

# 6. Create branch, add changes, commit, push, create PR (now works correctly)
```

**Prevention:** Always verify `gh api repos/ProtoJay4789/<name> --jq '.parent.full_name'` before attempting to use a fork for a PR against a specific upstream. If the parent doesn't match, the fork is stale.

## Phase 2: Formatting Rules for PR Body

### Required Sections (exact names from template)

Every PR body MUST include the exact sections from the repo's PR template. If the template has:

```
## Description
...
## Checklist
...
```

Then our PR body must have **those exact headings** with the **same markdown syntax**.

### Checklist Items

- All boxes must be **checked** with `[x]` (not `[ ]` or `[X]`)
- Do not add items that aren't in the template
- Do not remove items that are in the template

### Description Content

- Match the repo's tone and style
- Be specific about what you changed and why
- Reference the repo name and section you added to

## Maintenance: Auto-Rebase Policy (Tier 1 Only)

**Jordan directive (Jul 17, 2026):** PR merge conflicts at Tier 1 are auto-rebased without asking. Do NOT queue them or ask permission. Only Tier 2/3 (cost >$0.10 or needs a decision) get added to Jordan's build queue.

**When a PR has merge conflicts (CONFLICTING):**
1. Check tier: `gh pr view <number> -R owner/repo --json mergeable,additions,deletions`
   - **Tier 1** (small fix, < 100 lines, no decision needed): Auto-rebase immediately — no notification needed
   - **Tier 2/3**: Add to Jordan's build queue, do NOT rebase

**Tier 1 auto-rebase workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Get the PR's diff first (before anything else)
gh pr diff <number> -R owner/repo > /tmp/pr-rebase.diff

# 2. Find the fork and branch info
INFO=$(gh pr view <number> -R owner/repo --json headRefName,headRepository --jq \
  '{branch: .headRefName, fork: .headRepository.nameWithOwner}')
BRANCH=$(echo "$INFO" | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['branch'])")
FORK=$(echo "$INFO" | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['fork'])")
UPSTREAM="owner/repo"
echo "PR branch: $BRANCH (on fork: $FORK)"

# 3. Clone and set up remotes (fresh temp dir avoids stale state)
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$TMPDIR"
git clone "https://github.com/$UPSTREAM.git" .
# In a fresh clone 'origin' = UPSTREAM, not the fork
git remote add fork "https://github.com/$FORK.git"
git fetch fork "$BRANCH"

# 4. Create branch and rebase
git checkout -b rebase-branch fork/$BRANCH
if git rebase origin/main; then
  # Rebase succeeded — push to the FORK remote, which auto-updates the PR
  git push fork rebase-branch:$BRANCH --force
  echo "Rebased and pushed"
else
  echo "Rebase has conflicts — need resolution"
  # See conflict resolution below
fi
```

**⚠️ Pitfall — `origin` is the upstream, not the fork, in a fresh clone.** When you `git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git`, `origin` is the upstream repo. Pushing `git push origin <branch> --force` will 403 because you don't have write access there. Always add the fork as a separate remote (e.g., `fork`) and push there. Use `gh pr view <number> --json headRepository --jq '.headRepository.nameWithOwner'` to get the fork's full name programmatically.

**⚠️ Pitfall — `GIT_EDITOR=true` for automated rebase continue.** Some git versions do not support `git rebase --continue --no-edit`. In automated environments, use `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue` to avoid the "Terminal is dumb, but EDITOR unset" error. This sets the editor to a no-op that preserves the staged commit message.

**⚠️ Pitfall — read_file's `LINE|CONTENT` format can inject stray characters into patch strings.** When you use `read_file` to inspect a file (which prepends `LINE_NUMBER|` to each line), and then copy that output into a `patch` call's `old_string` or `new_string`, the `|` separator and line number can end up as literal characters in your edit. The patch tool applies them verbatim, inserting a stray `|` prefix at the start of each affected line. Always reconstruct markdown list entries from scratch when patching — never copy-paste from read_file's output. If your patch produces lines starting with `|-` instead of `-`, a stray `|` was included in the old_string or new_string.

**Mechanical conflict resolution (README.md / awesome-list repos):**
When the rebase hits a content conflict (most common in awesome-list READMEs where both upstream and our branch added entries near each other):

```bash
# 1. Find the conflict markers
grep -n "<<<<<<\|======\|>>>>>>" README.md

# 2. Read around the conflict to understand what each side added:
#    HEAD = upstream (entries other contributors added while our PR was open)
#    Our branch = our PR's entry(ies)
#    Resolution = keep ALL entries from both sides, in their correct positions

# 3. Edit the file to resolve (using patch tool, not manual editor):
#    - Keep every entry from HEAD (upstream)
#    - Keep every entry from our branch
#    - Normalize list-bullet prefixes to the upstream format (`-` not `|-` or `||-`)
#    - Remove all conflict markers
#    - Ensure no duplicate entries

# 4. Stage and continue
git add README.md
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue
```

**Branch ghosted recovery** (use when the fork branch no longer exists — happened with Hermes #50239):
```bash
# The branch was deleted from the fork (auto-cleanup). Recreate from diff.
git checkout -b <branch> upstream/main
git apply /tmp/pr-rebase.diff
git add -A && git commit -m "<original commit title from the PR>"
git push origin <branch> --force
```
The PR auto-updates because the branch name matches the PR's head ref. Then comment:
`"Rebased onto current main — all conflicts resolved. Ready for review."`

**Tier 2/3 flow (do NOT rebase):**
1. Add to build_queue.json with next available ID (expected at `${VAULT_DIR}/11-Mess Hall/build_queue.json`; create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Set status: "pending", assigned_to: "gentech" (Tier 2) or "jordan" (Tier 3), priority: high
3. Include detail field with: PR number, repo, conflict description, what the PR does
4. Report it in the daily summary — Jordan scans these

**Build completion reporting** (after all PRs processed):
- Inventory ALL open GentechLabs PRs via the REST-based repo iteration (see Phase 0 step 1 — iterate the Known PR Targets seed list)
- For each: check mergeable status (MERGEABLE/CONFLICTING/DIRTY/UNKNOWN) with `gh pr view <number> -R <owner/repo> --json mergeable,state`
- Report as a table: PR #, Repo, Status, Action Taken (rebase/skip/queued), Notes
- Separately list what was built/shipped this run vs what remains pending
- The goal: Jordan can scan in 30 seconds and know the state of the entire PR portfolio

**Tracking merged PRs:**
To find recently merged GentechLabs PRs between scans, use the REST-based repo iteration with a `state=closed` filter and check `merged_at`:

```bash
for repo in "owner/repo1" "owner/repo2"; do
  gh api "repos/$repo/pulls?state=closed&per_page=5&sort=updated&direction=desc" --jq \
    '[.[] | select(.user.login == "GentechLabs" and .merged_at != null) | {number, title, html_url, merged_at}]'
done
```
Key fields to report per merged PR: `html_url` (clickable link), `number`, `merged_at`,
`title`. Include the count of merged PRs in your build summary — it is the single most
important metric for portfolio health. A PR that's been merged reduces the open count
and increases our ecosystem presence.

**⚠️ Pitfall — `search/issues is:merged` returns `null` for `merged_at` on PRs.**
The GitHub Search API does not include `merged_at` in its index for `is:merged` PR
queries, even though the field exists in the PR's API response. Verified Jul 19 2026:
two genuinely merged PRs (gold-402#39, xpaysh/x402#701) both returned `merged_at: null`
from `gh api search/issues ... is:merged`. This is not a transient issue — it is a
consistent API limitation.

**Fix — verify with `gh pr view` after the search:**
After running the search query, use `gh pr view` to get the real `mergedAt` for every
result that returned null:
```bash
# After the search above, pipe each null result to gh pr view
for pr in "owner/repo#123" "owner2/repo2#456"; do
  repo=$(echo $pr | cut -d# -f1)
  num=$(echo $pr | cut -d# -f2)
  gh pr view $num -R $repo --json state,mergedAt,mergedBy,title --jq \
    '{pr, state, mergedAt, mergedBy: (.mergedBy.login // "none"), title}'
done
```
The `gh pr view` endpoint always returns accurate `mergedAt` for merged PRs and `null`
for still-open PRs (which is correct — they haven't been merged yet).

**Filtering trick:** The `search/issues` query can report a PR as merged even when
`merged_at` is temporarily null during active merge processing. A follow-up `gh pr view`
5 minutes later will resolve it. If a PR shows as "open" in the search but reports
state=MERGED from `gh pr view`, trust `gh pr view` — the search index lags by up to
a few minutes on merge events.

## Phase 3: After Submission — Monitor for 60 Seconds

1. After `gh pr create`, wait 60 seconds
2. **Verify the PR actually exists on GitHub** — `gh pr create` can fail silently (rate limits, fork-name collisions, or the fork was deleted between creation and submission). Check:
   ```bash
   # Verify the fork still exists and is a fork of the right upstream
   gh api repos/Gentech-Labs/<repo-name> --jq '{fork, parent: .parent.full_name}'
   
   # Verify the PR exists and is open
   gh pr view <number> -R <owner/repo> --json state,mergeable,title --jq '{state, mergeable, title}'
   ```
   If the fork returns 404 or the parent doesn't match the target upstream, the PR was never actually created. Log it as a failed submission and re-fork.
   
   **⚠️ Pitfall — Forks can be deleted between creation and PR submission.** This happened Jul 19 2026: all 7 ecosystem PRs and 2 protocol PRs were "submitted" in our tracking but never actually existed on GitHub. The forks were deleted (auto-cleanup, stale fork cleanup, or never persisted from a prior session). Always verify fork existence before and after PR creation. A PR that exists only in our tracking is a phantom PR — it wastes reviewer time and damages our reputation when maintainers see stale PR references.

   **⚠️ Pitfall — REST API can return cached PR data from a dead token.** On Jul 22 2026, the token was invalidated but the REST API continued returning PR data (cached from the token's last valid state). Every single PR returned 404 when verified via browser. The API output was a ghost — the PRs never actually existed on GitHub. **Always verify critical PRs via browser or web_extract when the token is suspect.** A PR that exists only in API output but not on the web is a phantom. See references/token-death-recovery.md for the full incident report.

3. Run `gh pr view <number> --json comments` to check for bot flags
4. If a bot flagged format issues (missing sections, wrong template):
   - Read the exact error
   - Fix the PR body immediately with `gh pr edit <number> --body "<fixed body>"`
   - Verify the fix passed
5. **Verify PR description accuracy against the actual diff** — This check runs even when bot checks pass (bots like Greptile don't verify PR body claims):
   ```bash
   gh pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo> | head -80
   gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json body --jq '.body'
   ```
   - Compare the diff's actual changes against the PR body's description
   - If the body claims entries/sections that don't appear in the diff, fix immediately:
     ```bash
     gh pr edit <number> -R <owner/repo> --body "<corrected body>"
     ```
   - **Real trap**: A PR passing all bot checks at 5/5 confidence can still have a factually wrong description (e.g. body says "added to two sections" but diff only changes one section). Maintainers read the description, not just the bot score. This exact pattern was discovered in PR #197 (awesome-solana-ai).
   - If the diff and body match but could be clearer or more specific, tighten the language rather than leaving vague descriptions.
5. If the PR was auto-closed by a bot:
   - Fix the body
   - Attempt reopen: `gh pr reopen <number>`
   - **If reopen fails** (e.g. `GraphQL: Could not open the pull request`):
     - **Diagnose:** Check if the fork branch still exists:
       ```bash
       gh pr view <number> --json headRefName,headRepository --jq '{branch: .headRefName, fork: .headRepository.nameWithOwner}'
       git ls-remote --heads https://github.com/<fork>/<repo>.git <branch>
       ```
     - **If branch was deleted** (common on repos that auto-cleanup branches on PR close):
       1. Check what the original PR changed:
          ```bash
          gh pr diff <number> > /tmp/original-pr-diff.diff
          ```
       2. Sync fork `main` to upstream:
          ```bash
          gh repo fork <upstream/repo> --clone --fork-name <fork-name> 2>/dev/null || true
          git checkout main && git pull upstream main && git push origin main
          ```
       3. Create a new branch from the synced main:
          ```bash
          git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
          ```
       4. Re-apply the changes (either cherry-pick from the diff, or manually re-edit)
       5. Commit, push, and create a new PR with the same (corrected) body:
          ```bash
          git add -A && git commit -m "<original title>"
          git push -u origin <new-branch-name>
          gh pr create -R <upstream/repo> --head <fork>:<new-branch-name> --base main \
            --title "<title>" --body "<corrected body>"
          ```
     - **If branch still exists**, the reopen failure may be a transient GitHub API issue:
       Retry once. If it still fails, delete and recreate the PR.
   - Or close it and submit a new PR with the correct format (same branch-recreation flow if needed)

## Common Bot Traps

| Bot | Trigger | Fix |
|-----|---------|-----|
| github-actions template check | Missing ## Description or ## Checklist | Add the exact sections from the PR template. If PR was already closed, see Phase 3 point 4 for branch-recreation workflow. |
| github-actions branch cleanup | Fork branch auto-deleted after PR close | `gh pr reopen` will fail with GraphQL error. Use the branch-recreation fallback in Phase 3 point 4. |
| github-actions commit signing | "Note that we require commit signing, please rebase and verify your commits." | **Prevention:** Same as CLA-bot — verify `git config user.email` is a GitHub-verified email and that a GPG signing key is configured. On this build node, GPG signing is NOT set up.\\n\\n**If already flagged:**\\n1. **Fix the author email FIRST** (same CLA-bot workflow — amend author, force-push). The bot auto-re-scans on push.\\n2. **After the push, check if the bot has a NEW comment or if its existing comment updated** (the re-scan may take 5-30 seconds). If the signing flag is still raised, the commit is now correctly authored BUT still unsigned — proceed to step 3. If the bot went silent, the author fix alone resolved it.\\n3. **If the commit is correctly authored but still unsigned:** This requires GPG key setup on the signing machine — it cannot be automated from a headless build node.\\n   - **Comment on the PR** with the exact commands for Jordan (step-by-step: clone, checkout branch, `git commit --amend --gpg-sign --no-edit`, force-push).\\n   - **Tier 3 escalation:** Add to build_queue.json assigned_to: "jordan".\\n   - **Alternative:** If the repo allows GitHub UI squash-and-merge, it may not require a signature from the individual commit.\\n\\n**Key difference from CLA-bot:** Commit signing checks the GPG signature of the commit object, not the author email. Both the author identity AND the cryptographic signature must validate independently. A commit with a correct author but no GPG signature will always be blocked. The fix sequence (author first, then signing) matters because force-pushing after the author amend triggers a bot re-scan that may surface the signing blocker separately from the author issue. |
| awesome-lint | Wrong list format, broken links | Fix bullet format, check links resolve |
| CLA-bot | Commit author email not linked to a GitHub identity | **Prevention:** Verify `git config user.email` is a GitHub-verified email for ProtoJay4789 BEFORE committing. Verified emails: `jordanjones0902@gmail.com` and `91908594+ProtoJay4789@users.noreply.github.com`. Do NOT use `gentech@protojay4789.github.io` — it is not linked to the GitHub account and will always trigger CLA-bot.\n\n**If already flagged:**\n1. **First, verify the actual commit author** (don't assume it's wrong):\n   ```bash\n   git log -1 --format="%an <%ae>"\n   ```\n2. **If author is already correct** (ProtoJay4789 with a verified email above), just re-trigger the check:\n   ```bash\n   gh issue comment <PR_NUMBER> -R owner/repo --body "@cla-bot check"\n   ```\n3. **If author is wrong** (e.g., `Gentech <gentech@protojay4789.github.io>`), amend and force-push, then re-trigger:\n   ```bash\n   git commit --amend --author="ProtoJay4789 <jordanjones0902@gmail.com>" --no-edit\n   git push --force\n   gh issue comment <PR_NUMBER> -R owner/repo --body "@cla-bot check"\n   ```\n\n**Option B (standalone CLA portals, e.g., e2b-dev):** Jordan signs the CLA directly on the contributor portal (the bot's comment includes the link). Once signed, the check auto-passes — no commit amend needed. |
| Greptile | Empty OpenAPI paths, missing descriptions | Add real paths and descriptions |
| Greptile | Pricing mismatch (PAY.md vs spec) | Ensure `per_request` matches `x-payment-info.price.amount` in spec |
| **Greptile** | **Duplicate JSON keys in OpenAPI spec (e.g., two `parameters` blocks on same endpoint)** | **JSON allows duplicate keys, but parsers silently keep ONLY the last one — the first is silently dropped. After patching an OpenAPI JSON, verify no duplicate keys: `python3 -c \"import json; d=json.load(open('f.json')); [[print(f'❌ {p} ({m}): {c} params') for c in [sum(1 for k in s if k=='parameters')] if c>1] for p,ms in d.get('paths',{}).items() for m,s in ms.items()]\"`** |
| **git diff** | **PR diff contains unintended deletions of other contributors' entries (rebase artifact)** | **Before pushing, compare diff against upstream/main: `git diff upstream/main --stat`. If deletions appear that you didn't intend, the branch deviated from upstream. Fix by adding those entries back in their original position, then verify diff shows only your intended additions.** |
| **git diff** | **PR diff shows 20+ changes for a 1-line addition (line-ending pollution)** | **The diff is polluted by CRLF→LF normalization or trailing-whitespace cleanup across the whole file. Maintainers will reject it. Fix: `git diff --stat` against upstream main — if every line in the file shows changed, reset it: `git checkout upstream/main -- <file>`, re-apply your single-line edit, then verify `git diff upstream/main --stat` shows only your intended additions. Use `git add --renormalize .` if the repo expects specific line endings (check `.gitattributes`).** |
| Greptile | Category mismatch (CONTRIBUTING.md enum) | Re-categorize per target repo's contributing rules |
| Greptile | Shared OpenAPI bleeding across services | Create per-service openapi.json files |
| Greptile | Missing Algorand network in sub-provider PAY.md | Sync network list from master to every per-service spec |
| **Greptile** | **Missing parameters on paid endpoints** | **Every paid endpoint needs a `parameters` block with at least a `q` (query, required) param. Without it, spec-driven agents can't construct valid requests and Greptile flags the endpoints as "impossible to call correctly from the spec."** |
| Greptile | OpenAPI description contradicts PAY.md use case | Ensure `summary` fields in OpenAPI align with the `use_case` and `description` in PAY.md frontmatter. If OpenAPI says "crypto DEX aggregator" but PAY.md says "retail price comparison", Greptile flags the mismatch. |
| **git push** | **Embedded HTTPS token expired** | If push fails with "Invalid username or token", run `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git` (removes the embedded token) and retry. `gh auth` handles token refresh. |
| **git branch -f** | **PR branch needs to point at a different commit (can't amend — wrong fork, different machine, stale base)** | Use `git branch -f <PR-branch> <source-branch>` to repoint the PR's branch at a different commit, then `git push origin <PR-branch> --force` to update the PR. Verify with `gh pr view <number> --json headRefName,headRepository --jq '.headRefName'`. This replaces the entire branch content — use when `git commit --amend` isn't possible (e.g., CLA-bot on a commit from a different identity). Combines with line-endings fix when the PR points at a branch that needs different CRLF handling. |
| **git stash** | **Merge conflicts when popping stash across branches** | Stashing changes on branch A and checking out branch B (with different versions of the same files) causes merge conflicts on stash pop. Commit before switching, or use `git checkout <source> -- <file>` to cherry-pick specific file changes. |
| **mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED** | **PR is mergeable but blocked by branch protection (stale branch, missing CI checks)** | `mergeable: MERGEABLE` + `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` means no file conflicts, but branch protection is blocking the merge. Common causes: PR branch is behind base, required CI checks haven't run on fork PRs, or a required review is missing. This is NOT the same as CONFLICTING (which is a real file conflict).\n\n**Diagnose:**\n```bash\ngh pr view <number> -R <owner/repo> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup --jq '{\n  mergeable,\n  mergeStateStatus,\n  checks: [.statusCheckRollup[] | {context: .context, state: .state}]\n}'\n```\n- Empty `statusCheckRollup` + BLOCKED → branch protection expects CI that doesn't run on fork PRs. Needs maintainer override.\n- Non-empty failing checks + BLOCKED → fix the failed checks.\n- `behind` as mergeStateStatus → needs rebase onto base branch.\n\n**Action:** If BLOCKED with empty checks = maintainer-side issue, not our rebase problem. Log it and move on. If behind → standard rebase (see Auto-Rebase section above). Do NOT confuse with CONFLICTING — no rebase needed if behind alone and <100 lines (Tier 1). |
| **mergeStateStatus: UNSTABLE** | **PR checks haven't fully run yet (CI in progress)** | UNSTABLE means some required checks are still pending but none have failed. This is temporary — wait for checks to complete. No action needed unless it stays UNSTABLE for >2 hours, which suggests a CI infrastructure stall on the upstream side. NOT the same as BLOCKED (no action needed here, just patience). |
| Glama badge check | Missing Glama score badge in PR, or bot keeps asking despite badge being added | **Diagnose first:** Check the quality score page at `glama.ai/mcp/servers/<user>/<repo>/score`. This page reveals every blocker (release status, license presence, coherence score). If score is 0%, the badge SVG won't resolve even if the URL is correct.\\n\\n**Common blockers revealed by the score page:**\\n- **No Glama release** → score stays ~0-8%. Fix: Glama admin panel → Dockerfile admin → configure build spec → Deploy → Make Release.\\n- **No LICENSE file** → score page shows "F" for license. Fix: Add an MIT or Apache-2.0 LICENSE to the repo root. Without it, the MCP server cannot be installed from Glama and the score never passes.\\n- **Author not verified / No glama.json** → contributes to low score but is optional. Add `glama.json` with the maintainer's GitHub username to fix author verification.\\n\\n**Score threshold note:** Even a low non-zero score (e.g., 17% with no release + no license) lets the badge SVG resolve (HTTP 200). The real gate is zero percent — at 0% the SVG literally cannot render. A low non-zero score counts as "resolved" from the bot's perspective. To fully pass the Glama check, the server must eventually have a release on Glama, but even an incomplete profile with a non-zero score satisfies the badge-must-resolve requirement.

**Score page diagnostic checklist (what the score page reveals):**
- **Has a Glama release** → score jumps to ~50-67% (genTech-agent-kit: 67% with release)
- **No Glama release** → score stays ~0-17% (genTech-shop: 17% without release)
- **No LICENSE file** → score page shows "F" for license. Without it, the MCP server cannot be installed from Glama and the score never passes the 17% ceiling.
- **Server Coherence** → only scored after a release exists. genTech-agent-kit scored "C" (67% overall).
- **Tool Definition Quality** → only scored after a release exists.
- **Maintenance** → scored independently of release (genTech-shop scored "A" for maintenance despite 17% overall).
- **Badge resolves at any non-zero score** — even 17% returns HTTP 200 for the SVG. The bot only checks that the badge URL resolves, not the score value.\\n\\n**Badge SVG URLs:** `/badges/score.svg` and `/badges/card.svg` — the score badge is the one the checklist bot checks. Once the score is non-zero, the badge resolves visibly and the bot passes on re-scan.\\n\\n**Bot re-trigger:** The Glama bot auto-re-scans on new commits. If you've fixed a blocking item (added LICENSE, made a release) but the bot hasn't re-checked, a push to the PR branch triggers it. No manual comment needed. |
| CodeRabbit | Code quality or style issues | Address specific comments |
| **Auto-close (stale bot)** | **PR auto-closed without merge despite being MERGEABLE/CLEAN with maintainer confirmation** | **Check `closed_by` — if `null`, it was auto-closed by GitHub's stale-bot or similar, not by a human. The PR was valid but the repo's stale-bot policy closed it after inactivity. Recovery: reopen with `gh pr reopen <number>`, or if that fails (branch deleted), recreate the PR from the original diff. Add a comment explaining the fix is still relevant. Example: GOATNetwork/agentkit#6 — MERGEABLE/CLEAN, confirmed by maintainer Manuel-dev01, auto-closed Jul 20 with `closed_by: null`.** |

**Greptile re-trigger:** After pushing fixes, Greptile auto-re-scans on new commits. No manual trigger needed. If it doesn't re-scan within a few minutes, the push may not have reached the PR branch — verify the commit is visible with `gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'`.

## Awesome Lists (No Template)

Awesome-list repos often lack PR templates. See `references/awesome-list-contributions.md` for:
- Alphabetical ordering rules
- Description style matching
- No-template PR body format
- Post-submit verification for awesome-list repos

See `references/awesome-list-agent-fast-track.md` for:
- 🤖🤖🤖 agent fast-track pattern (append to PR title for auto-merge)
- Glama.ai badge requirements for MCP server listings
- pay-skills catalog pricing sync pitfalls (Greptile)

### YAML Catalog Repos (projects.yaml / Data-Driven Lists)

Some best-of lists (e.g., tolkonepiu/best-of-mcp-servers) use a `projects.yaml` file
instead of direct README.md edits. The README is auto-generated from the YAML data.

**Key differences from README-based submissions:**

- **Do NOT edit README.md** — the auto-generator will overwrite your changes
- Edit `projects.yaml` in the correct alphabetical position within the file
- One project per PR (most enforce this via CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Title format: `Add project: project-name` (per CONTRIBUTING.md convention)
- YAML entry format:
  ```yaml
  - name: my-project-name
    github_id: org/repo
    description: One-line description of what it does.
    category: finance-and-fintech
  ```
- Categories are defined at the top of `projects.yaml` — pick the one that fits best
- `name` is the display name (often matches the repo name)
- `github_id` is the full org/repo path
- The scraper checks `stargazers_count`, `pushed_at`, license from the GitHub API — keep your repo active and licensed

**Verification:** The auto-generator produces README.md from the YAML — your entry
appears in the correct section automatically based on its `category` field. No
manual README edit needed.

**Worked example (best-of-mcp-servers #317, Jul 18 2026):**
```bash
# 1. Fork + clone
gh repo fork tolkonepiu/best-of-mcp-servers --clone
cd best-of-mcp-servers

# 2. Create branch
git checkout -b add-gentech-agent-kit

# 3. Add to projects.yaml in alphabetical position
#    Inserted between OctagonAI/octagon-mcp-server and QuantConnect/mcp-server
#    (P comes after O, before Q)
patch ...  # or edit directly

# 4. Commit and push
git add projects.yaml
git commit -m "Add project: Gentech-Labs/genTech-agent-kit"
git push -u origin add-gentech-agent-kit

# 5. Create PR
gh pr create -R tolkonepiu/best-of-mcp-servers \
  --head GentechLabs:add-gentech-agent-kit \
  --base main \
  --title "Add project: Gentech-Labs/genTech-agent-kit" \
  --body "Add to Finance & Fintech section.\n\nDescription of what it does."
```
Result: MERGEABLE with no bot flags on first submission.

## Fallback: If Unsure

If a repo's format rules are unclear:
1. Look at recently merged PRs for examples
2. Match their format exactly
3. If still unsure, ask in an issue before submitting

## Scheduling — PR Maintainer (4x Daily, 4 Repos Per Run)

**Jordan directive (Jul 21, 2026):** PR work runs 4x daily at 8:30am, 12:30pm, 4:30pm, and 8:30pm ET. Each run picks EXACTLY 4 repos to scan, rotating through a tracking file so every repo gets checked at least once per day.

**Mission shift (Jul 21, 2026):** We are no longer contributing to random repos. The strategy is now **strategic ecosystem listing** — placing our services where agents and builders discover tools. The north star: *"Enabling anyone to get paid for what they build."*

**Current PR cron:**
- PR Maintainer: `30 8,12,16,20 * * *` (8:30am, 12:30pm, 4:30pm, 8:30pm ET)
- 4 repos per run, tracked in `/root/.pr-maintainer-rotation.txt`
- ~8-12 API calls per run — well within 5,000/hr budget

**What the consolidated cron does:**
1. **Ecosystem Listing (Priority)** — Find directories, registries, and marketplaces where GenTech services should be listed. Submit PRs with the pitch: "Enabling anyone to get paid for what they build — x402 micropayments, agent treasuries, DeFi yield automation."
2. **Inbox Maintenance** — Check existing PRs for comments, CI failures, mergeability. Respond to reviewer feedback. Do NOT open new PRs to random projects.
3. **Rate Limit Management** — Start with inbox check (5-10 calls), then ecosystem discovery via web search (free, no API cost). Only scan repos if budget allows. If rate limited, report it and stop — next run picks up where you left off.

**Rotation file format** (`/root/.pr-maintainer-rotation.txt`):
```
last_run: 2026-07-21 14:30
repos_checked: repo1, repo2, repo3, repo4
repos_pending: repo5, repo6, repo7, ...
```

**Rate limit strategy:**
- 4 repos × ~2-3 calls each = 8-12 API calls per run. Well within 5,000/hr budget.
- Web search for ecosystem discovery (free, no API cost)
- If rate limited, report it and stop — next run picks up where rotation left off
- After all repos checked, rotation resets and starts over

**Rule:** Never scan more than 4 repos per run. If Jordan wants a full deep scan, he'll ask manually.

### Compact Reporting (Critical for Cron Outputs)

PR Maintainer delivers to HQ every 4 hours. Jordan reads these on Telegram — wall-of-text outputs get ignored.

**Principle: Only report what changed.**
- NEW PRs (not seen in previous run)
- PRs that MERGED since last run
- PRs with new comments, review requests, or bot flags
- PRs that need Jordan's action
- **Do NOT re-list** every PR every run — suppress unchanged ones

**Format — Jordan scans in 5 seconds:**
```
✅ Account: GentechLabs · 105 repos

📬 PR Status:
• owner/repo#123 — MERGEABLE (no change)

```

No full PR lists. No PRs that haven't changed since last scan. A recurring cron that dumps every status every run creates noise that buries the signal.

**Pitfall — REST `/pulls` endpoint consumes budget faster than the 5,000/hr estimate suggests.** The 5,000/hr budget is shared across ALL `gh api` calls in the session — repo listing, user lookups, notification checks, and prior operations all consume it. On Jul 21 the 2:30pm run exhausted the REST budget after only ~10 PR-status calls, despite the estimate suggesting 48+ should be safe. The `/pulls` endpoint carries a higher per-call cost than simpler endpoints like `/repos/owner/repo`. After exhaustion, `gh api rate_limit` may still report 59 remaining — that endpoint shows a different bucket. **Prevention:** If any `gh api` calls ran earlier in the session (wake-up, vault checks, prior tasks), factor that into the PR budget. Assume ~30-40 PR-status calls per session max when the budget was partially consumed.

**Pitfall — Combined REST + GraphQL exhaustion.** Running BOTH a REST batch scan (45+ `gh api repos/...` calls) AND a GraphQL batch scan (45+ `gh pr view` calls) in the same session can exhaust BOTH budgets. The REST API (5000/hr) seems inexhaustible but prior operations (repo listing, user lookups, notification checks) consume it, and the `/pulls` endpoint itself carries a higher per-call cost than simpler endpoints. After both are exhausted, `gh api rate_limit` may still report 59 remaining — that endpoint shows a different bucket. Do NOT trust `rate_limit` as a reliable indicator of REST availability. When ALL PRs return `mergeable: null`, you are rate-limited, not waiting for GitHub to compute mergeability. **Strategy:** if running an inbox scan and REST budget is already partially consumed (e.g., by prior `gh api` calls in the session), skip the full REST iteration and go straight to the compact tier-1 approach: check only the ~10 most recently updated repos from the seed list.

**Pitfall — `mergeable: null` across ALL PRs means rate-limited, not computing.** When the REST API returns `mergeable: null` for every PR in a batch scan, this is a rate-limit signal, not a transient compute delay. GitHub returns `null` for individual PRs when the mergeability check hasn't finished computing, but when ALL 45+ PRs return null simultaneously, the API is refusing the requests. Stop the scan and fall back to the last known state from the previous run.

## ⛔ NEVER RECORD A PR AS MERGED/SUBMITTED WITHOUT AN AUTHENTICATED PER-PR READ

**False receipts shipped in our own registry and sat green for weeks.** Rows claimed PRs that do not exist — and they
cited a *lower, real-looking* number than our actual PR, which is exactly why nobody re-read them.

- **"Internet Court PR #7 ✅ MERGED — vendored as partner skill"** — PR #7 does not exist (404 anonymously *and*
  authenticated). Our real PR is **#25**, open. We are **not** a vendored partner: 33 `vendored/` directories, none
  ours; no `NOTICE.md` row; 0 gentech paths in the full 1,024-path repo tree.
- **"PR #6 merged into GOAT agentkit, PR #7 submitted"** — on `GOATNetwork/agentkit` #6 belongs to `pankaj148` and #7
  to `ExpertVagabond`; neither is ours, neither is merged. **Ours is #9** (open). The `❌ PR #6 auto-closed` row above
  is the same false class.

**⚠️ Every `✅ PR #N submitted` row in this seed list is the same class of claim and is NOT independently verified.**
Treat them as *claimed*, not *confirmed*, until an authenticated read re-proves them. A tracker row is not proof.

**Rules:**
1. **Record a PR number only after `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>` returns it.**
2. **Verify authenticated whenever a subject token exists.** The repo's public PR list omits our PRs entirely, so an
   anonymous read yields a **false negative that masquerades as a finding.**
3. **Absence from a public listing is NOT evidence of absence.** Our account is unsearchable — GitHub answers even an
   authenticated self-search with *"users cannot be searched… do not have permission to view."*
4. **`per_page=100` silently truncates** repos with more PRs than that (`r402` 133, `pay-skills` 257, `BankrBot/skills`
   640). Paginate until a short page, or you will "prove" a PR absent by only reading page 1.
5. **A merge claim needs the merge commit, not a status word.** Never write ✅ MERGED from memory or from a sibling row.
6. **Correcting a receipt is itself a claim.** If your correction reverses an earlier entry, re-read the source
   authenticated before publishing it — a "all 8 PRs ABSENT" draft was produced exactly this way mid-fix and was wrong.
7. **A contents-API directory count can include files** — count directories from the git tree API
   (`vendored/` reads 35 from contents, 33 from the tree).
8. **Patching a skill and then syncing from the vault will silently revert your patch** if you patch the seat copy.
   Patch the canonical vault copy first, then propagate outward.
