# Handoff Workflow — Gentech ↔ Forge

## Current Flow (Jul 27, 2026)

```
Gentech writes → 01-HANDOFFS/for-the-forge.md           (tasks for Forge)
                 01-HANDOFFS/gentech-to-forge/           (dated task files)

Forge writes   → 01-HANDOFFS/from-the-forge.md           (what Forge did)
                 01-HANDOFFS/forge-completions.md        (item IDs shipped)

Tick script    → scripts/tick_build_queue.py --apply     (reads completions → updates queue)

Vault sync     → git push vault → github.com/Gentech-Labs/gentech-vault.git
```

## The Loop

1. **Gentech** writes `01-HANDOFFS/for-the-forge.md` with current priority items
2. **Forge** reads it (from GitHub or local vault), works, writes `from-the-forge.md` + `forge-completions.md`
3. **Gentech** runs `python3 scripts/tick_build_queue.py --apply` to consume completions into the queue
4. **Gentech** writes a fresh `for-the-forge.md` with updated queue
5. Repeat

## Important

- **Forge sometimes pushes only to GitHub** — always `git push vault main` before reading handoffs
- **Tick script** lives at `scripts/tick_build_queue.py` — run with `--apply` after Forge completes
- **`02-HANDOFFS/forge-to-gentech/`** — archived, not used. Forge writes to `01-HANDOFFS/from-the-forge.md`
- **`gentech-vault-new`** — deprecated. All handoffs live in the root vault at `${VAULT_DIR}/01-HANDOFFS/`

## Tick Script

`scripts/tick_build_queue.py`:
- Reads `forge-completions.md` for shipped item IDs
- Updates `build_queue.json` (marks items as shipped, recalculates summary)
- Writes fresh `for-the-forge.md` with current queue
- Clears `forge-completions.md` for next cycle
- Dry-run with no args; apply with `--apply`

## Sync Protocol

Full protocol at `01-HANDOFFS/sync-protocol.md`.


> 🚫 **NEVER `git pull` the vault** — Obsidian Sync writes this same working tree, so a pull reads its changes as local edits and DIVERGES the clone (Forge: 842 phantom deletions / 886 changed files). **Receive by `ob sync`, deliver by `git push vault main` + `ob sync`.** See `00-System/vault-transport-protocol.md`.
