# Ecosystem Intelligence — Platform & Competitor Research

## When to Use

- A new platform, competitor, or potential partner is discovered
- Jordan says "look into X" or "research Y"
- Comparing two options (contribute vs integrate vs partner vs watch)
- Deciding whether to sign up for a new service
- **Jordan shares any URL** — GitHub repo, X post, blog, product page. Run the inbound analysis first.

## Inbound Analysis — "Eat the Meat, Spit Out the Bones"

**Default frame for every shared link.** Jordan's standing instruction (Jul 17, 2026): when he sends any URL, auto-scan for three dimensions. Do this before asking what he wants you to do with it.

### The Three-Way Scan

| # | Question | Examples |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | **USE** — Does this help GenTech? | Install the tool, apply the method, integrate the API |
| 2 | **CONTRIBUTE** — Can we add value back? | Submit an agent example, fix a bug, add x402 support, PR to their registry |
| 3 | **INTEGRATE** — Can we open doors both ways? | Plug into their plugin system, cross-reference each other's services, join their community |

### Template Response Structure

| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| 📖 Use | What we get from this |
| 🤝 Contribute | What we give back |
| 🔗 Integrate | Door opened both ways |

### When to Queue vs. Do Now

- Quick wins (<30 min): Do immediately — submit to registry, open an issue, fork and PR
- Medium effort: Add to build queue with priority assessment
- New connection: Save project name + contact to Mess Hall for later

### Examples from Practice

- CLI-Anything (45.5k⭐): Used their registry → contributed GenTech Agent Kit → PR #395
- Circuit SDK (1⭐): Used their x402 client patterns → contributed ecosystem listing → PR #1
- Agent Layer (22⭐): Referenced their wallet architecture → contributed x402 ecosystem section → PR #20
- 500 AI Agents (34.7k⭐): Used their agent catalog → contributed x402 payment agent example → PR #148

### Pitfall

Don't just analyze — act. If a quick PR is possible (docs change, registry entry, README fix), do it in the same session. Jordan's "eat the meat, spit out the bones" means absorb what's useful AND contribute back in one motion.

### Borrow Mechanisms, Not the Tool (framework/library evaluation)

When Jordan shares an agent **framework / tool / library** (not a single platform to integrate — an entire codebase or control-plane), the frame is: **which mechanisms do we fold into OUR stack?** Not "should we adopt it?" Proven Aug 3, 2026:
- **LoopX** (agent control-plane kernel, MIT) → did NOT adopt the tool; borrowed 3 primitives (explicit human gates, quota-aware `should-run`, evidence-lineage handoff stub) into `agent-handoff-enforcement`.
- **awesome-llm-apps multi-agent trust layer** (Apache-2.0, 130K★) → extracted delegation-scope narrowing + trust scoring as the a2a governance substrate.

**The pattern:**
1. **Verify it actually runs** — execute the self-contained demo/`main()` BEFORE recommending. A "reads well" codebase that doesn't run is a red flag.
2. **Check the license** — decides borrow-vs-build-on: permissive (MIT/Apache-2.0) = can fork/copy/build on; copyleft (AGPL/CC BY-NC-SA) = borrow the *idea*, write our own code.
3. **Map mechanism → our primitive** in a `| Their primitive | We already have | Gap? |` table — kills scope creep, surfaces only true gaps.
4. **Flag fixed security bugs** — e.g. trust layer's "empty `allowed_actions` set read as ALLOW" least-privilege hole → lesson: empty allow-list must mean DENY. Capture so our equivalent avoids it.
5. **Write comparison note** to `09-Green Room/specs/<name>-deep-dive.md` with borrow list + "spit out" list (what we consciously reject).
6. **Wire the borrow** into the governing skill / build queue.

See `references/a2a-trust-layer-and-loopx-borrows.md` for both worked examples and the exact primitives we took.

## The Research Deep Dive

### Step 1: Multi-Source Surface (5 min)

Visit in parallel:
1. **Website** — What do they claim? Product, pricing, target audience
2. **Docs** — Supported chains, token types, API endpoints, SDKs
3. **GitHub** — Open source? Stars? License? Recent activity? Repo structure?
4. **Twitter/X** — Recent posts, engagement, community sentiment

### Step 2: Capture Key Dimensions

Build a structured profile:

| Dimension | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Chain support** | Exact chain list, EVM compatibility, native tokens |
| **Open source** | Repos, license (MIT/Apache/closed), contribution culture |
| **Pricing** | Fees, tiers, token types, fiat off-ramp |
| **Agent features** | MCP support, agent cards, gasless payments, spending controls |
| **Traction** | Volume, users, payments, subscribers, backers |
| **Target audience** | Consumer vs merchant vs developer vs agent |
| **Competitive moat** | What's hard to replicate? (network effects, compliance, integrations) |

### Step 3: Head-to-Head Comparison

When comparing two options, use a split table:

```markdown
**Option A** — Closed source, merchant-first
| ✅ | ❌ |
|----|----|
| 8 chains, fiat settlement | Closed source |
| Built-in chargebacks | No agent-first features |
| Proven volume | Agent features feel bolted-on |

**Option B** — Open source, agent-first
| ✅ | ❌ |
|----|----|
| Open source (MIT) | Single chain only |
| Built for agents | Younger / less traction |
| Policy engine | No dispute system |
```

### Step 4: Integration Decision Matrix

| Path | When to Choose | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Contribute** | Open source, aligned mission, gaps we can fill | Sana Bot — PR'd GenTech x402 skill pack |
| **List** | Has a directory we should be in | Pay-Skills, awesome-* lists |
| **Partner** | Complementary product, mutual benefit | (future) |
| **Integrate** | Their API can power our product | x402 gateway → any payment provider |
| **Watch** | Interesting but not actionable yet | NodeRails — closed source, no chain match |
| **Skip** | Misaligned, dead, scam | Platforms with no agent use case |

### Step 5: Save to Vault

1. Write findings to a vault reference file: `10-Labs/research/<platform-name>-research.md`
2. If actionable, add to `scripts/build_queue.json` at high priority
3. If integration is decided, update `platform-registration` skill's Known Platforms table

## Awesome-List & MCP Directory Scanning — "Eat the Meat, Spit Out the Bones"

**Pattern proven Jul 28, 2026.** When Jordan shares a curated list (awesome-*, public-apis, MCP directories, etc.), scan it with this frame:

### The Three-Question Scan

| # | Question | Action |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **USE** — Does anything here help GenTech? | Install, integrate, or reference the tool |
| 2 | **CONTRIBUTE** — Can we add value back? | Submit our x402/MCP/agent listings to the directory |
| 3 | **SKIP** — Is this already covered by our stack? | Move on — don't add noise to the queue |

### Proven Results (Jul 28, 2026)

| List | Stars | What We Got | Action |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| awesome-mcp-servers | 91K⭐ | Found 7 x402-based MCP servers (ddg-agent-payable-services, coinopai-mcp, anomaly-mcp, 2s-io/sdk, pulsenetwork-mcp, agoragentic-integrations, cinderwright-api) | Contribute our listings |
| public-apis | 453K⭐ | Nothing new — Covalent, Etherscan, 0x, 1inch already accessible via BlockRun MCP | Skip |
| awesome-llm-apps | 116K⭐ | Starter templates only — fraud investigation agent and insurance claim agent mildly interesting | Low priority |
| awesome-selfhosted | 309K⭐ | Already self-host most of our stack | Quick audit queued |

### Pitfall

Don't add every discovery to the build queue. Most awesome-list entries are either (a) already covered by our stack, (b) starter templates we'd outgrow in a day, or (c) not relevant to agent/payment infrastructure. The queue should only get items that pass the USE or CONTRIBUTE test.

## Competition Intelligence — The Bottom-Tier Insight

**Pattern (discovered Jul 18, 2026 — DevFun Poker Arena):** In any competition we join, analyze the **bottom tier** of participants — not the leaders. The bottom-tier players are struggling with something they don't understand. Those struggles = potential customers.

**Why it works:** The leaders already have solutions. The bottom tier is the market — they're losing, frustrated, and would pay for a fix. We proved this in the DevFun Poker Arena: 249 agents entered, most had 0% VPIP from the same `availableActions` vs `actions` bug. A diagnostic service that catches that is worth real money.

**How to execute:**
1. Join the competition (cheap/free entry preferred)
2. Play honestly to understand the rules and API
3. When you hit a bug, document it — every other agent hitting the same thing is a customer
4. Check the leaderboard bottom quartile — their failure mode is your product opportunity
5. Build the fix → sell it to the bottom tier

**Example:** DevFun Poker — 312 hands at 0% VPIP → found `availableActions` bug → potential "Poker Agent Diagnostic" product for every agent below rank 100.

This is Jordan's "frustration to dollars" framework — their frustration is your revenue.

## Proven Work (Jul 15, 2026)

**NodeRails + WallCard deep dive:**
- Full-stack crypto payments (merchant gateway + consumer wallet)
- 8 production chains (Base, Eth, Arb, Opt, Poly, Solana, Sui)
- Built-in on-chain escrow with dispute resolution
- Fiat settlement to 100+ countries
- **Closed source** — zero public repos on GitHub
- ❌ No Avalanche support
- Agent features: agent crypto cards, gasless agent payments
- Decision: **Watch** — interesting but closed source, no chain match for Ava

**Sana Bot deep dive:**
- Agent-first banking platform (self-custodial Solana wallet, Signature Card)
- **Open source** (MIT, skill repo on GitHub)
- MCP gateway at mcp.sana.bot
- Skills for Hermes, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor
- Policy engine with spending controls
- Decision: **Contribute** — PR #3 submitted adding GenTech x402 skill pack

**Bankr (bankr.bot) deep dive (Jul 18, 2026):**\n- Web-native agent runtime with managed filesystem + crypto tooling  \n- **Token launching on Base** — $0 gas for first 3 deploys/day, 100B supply, 95% fees to creator\n- **Skill marketplace** — 105+ skills, PR #572 submitted (GenTech x402 gateway, mergeable)\n- **Open source** (1.2k⭐, 71 contributors, MIT-style)\n- **x402 native** — supports pay-per-call via x402 in multiple skills\n- Key metrics: $4.88B total volume, $19.39M creator fees, 63.9B LLM tokens\n- **Decision: Integrate** — Token launch + second skill (DeFi Yield Agent) queued. Nudge PR Friday.\n\n**Agentic.Market (Coinbase) — discovered Jul 21, 2026 (PR Maintainer run):**\n- Launched Apr 20, 2026. Public x402 marketplace. 165M+ tx, $50M+ volume, 480K+ agents.\n- **Self-indexing** — no manual submission. If the x402 gateway has the CDP Bazaar discovery extension, services auto-appear in the marketplace.\n- **Action:** Ensure x402 gateway exposes `/.well-known/x402` and Bazaar metadata. This is the single highest-visibility distribution channel in the x402 ecosystem.\n- **Decision: Enable Bazaar discovery** — Get listed without any manual process.\n\n**Circle Agent Marketplace — discovered Jul 21, 2026 (PR Maintainer run):**\n- Launched May 11, 2026. 32 services, 349 endpoints at launch. USDC via x402 with Circle's batched gateway middleware.\n- **Submit via Google Form** — requires a persistent external URL (tunnels die). Highest enterprise visibility.\n- **Decision: Submit** — USDC nanopayments align perfectly with GenTech's stack. Enterprise-grade credibility from Circle's backing.\n\n**nirholas/defi-agents — discovered Jul 21, 2026 (PR Maintainer run):**\n- 32★, 1,822 commits, 7 contributors. DeFi agent definitions JSON API + MCP.\n- Has `AGENTS.md` + `CONTRIBUTING.md` (standard PR process).\n- **Action:** Submit GenTech's DeFi/treasury agents as JSON definitions.\n- **Decision: Contribute** — Standard PR, low friction.\n\n**Other agent marketplaces noted (Jul 21, 2026):**\n- **MCP-Hive** — Per-invocation MCP marketplace. 0% for founding providers. PR-based listing.\n- **BuildMVPFast** — 80 services, 894 agents, 31,000 transactions in one week.\n- **MuleRun (max-productive.ai)** — $100-$10k launch bonuses. 200 free credits/day.\n- **dealwork.ai** — Job marketplace for AI agents. $1-$200 avg task value. 15% fee.\n- **opentask.ai** — Agent-to-agent tasks with USDC escrow. ~5-10% fee.\n- **Toku (toku.agency)** — Fixed-price agent services marketplace. 15% fee.\n- **Near AI Marketplace** — Agent gig marketplace on NEAR protocol.\n- **execution.market** — On-chain microtask escrow on Base. 13% fee.\n- **Moltbook** — AI social platform (karma, followers, community building).

**Monid (monid.ai) — discovered Jul 29, 2026:**
- **"OpenRouter for agent tools"** — one integration gives agents access to 1,300+ tools across 13+ providers. Pay-per-call, no subscriptions, one balance.
- **Supports:** Claude, Codex, Cursor, **Hermes** (we're listed in their "works with" section), and others.
- **Context.dev partnership** — web scraping/crawling partner. Turns any URL into clean structured data (markdown, HTML, JSON, brand kits, screenshots). Could replace Firecrawl (dead — Nous Portal credits exhausted).
- **Three connection methods:** Skill (one line into agent chat), MCP (remote MCP server), CLI (terminal install).
- **x402 support:** Their docs have a dedicated page at `/guide/pay-with-x402`. They already speak our protocol.
- **Tool provider program:** "Become a tool provider" at bottom of homepage. Google Form to apply: `https://forms.gle/NLPchCCwnTP6zQhV8`. They route agent traffic, meter calls, share revenue.
- **Already lists Blockrun** — they're in our ecosystem. Listing our services alongside Blockrun makes sense.
- **$1 free credit** to start — low risk to try.
- **What we'd list:** Yield Rainbow Data, GTA Arb Scan, Narrative Rotation, Agent Treasury Report — all as x402 pay-per-call services.
- **Decision: Apply as tool provider** — Fill out the Google Form to list our x402 gateway services. This puts us in front of every agent using Monid's platform.

**Xona Labs / xPay (xona-labs/xpay) — discovered Jul 29, 2026:**
- **Agentic-commerce wallet** for Solana. Multi-network USDC wallet, x402 payments, AgenC marketplace hires, and discovery across 20,000+ services — as a CLI, SDK, and MCP server.
- **npm package:** `@xona-labs/xpay` v0.2.22, MIT license, 83 commits, 1 star (early stage)
- **Stack:** Privy custody, x402 rails (same protocol we use), PayAI discovery, AgenC marketplace, Jupiter swaps, token discovery, balance reports
- **Discovery mechanism:** Pulls from OrbitX402 (api.orbitx402.com) which aggregates PayAI catalog + pay.sh catalog + its own probed resources. Agents call `xpay_discover "yield farm"` → ranked results → `xpay_use` handles x402 payment automatically.
- **Key overlap with GenTech:** Both use x402 protocol. They're Solana-first, we're multi-chain (Base, Avalanche, Solana). They focus on e-commerce/service discovery; we focus on DeFi yield/treasury management.
- **Where we fit together:**
  1. Their xPay could distribute our x402 gateway services (21K+ service catalog)
  2. Our DeFi intelligence could feed their agent commerce layer
  3. Both on x402 — same payment protocol, straightforward integration
  4. They're wallet/commerce layer; we're treasury/intelligence layer. Complementary.
- **Registration paths:**\n  - **x402-list.com/submit** — Web form: service name, base URL, website, email, category, description, endpoint paths. Auto-probes for HTTP 402, then manual review. Free.\n  - **⚠️ Path validation pitfall:** The form rejects endpoint paths containing `{address}`, `{symbol}`, or any curly-brace path parameters. Use flat paths like `/v1/security/score` instead of `/v1/security/score/{address}`. The first submission with curly-brace paths is rejected by the validator but still counts against the 7-day cooldown per email. If rejected, wait 7 days or resubmit via their API with a $0.50 x402 payment.\n  - **PayAI Bazaar** — Register via facilitator at facilitator.payai.network. Has `/discovery/resources` endpoint. Once listed, flows into OrbitX402 → xPay discovery automatically.
- **Our gateway status:** Already returns proper HTTP 402 with full Bazaar manifest at `api.gentechlabs.net/.well-known/x402-bazaar`. Ready for submission.
- **Decision: Register on x402-list.com + PayAI Bazaar** — Fastest path to xPay discovery. Then reach out to Xona Labs directly.
- See `references/xona-labs-jul-2026.md` for full codebase analysis.

**Kite AI Passport (gokite-ai/passport-skills) — discovered Jul 27, 2026:**
- **14 MIT-licensed x402 skills** published via skills.sh: authenticate-user, request-session, attach-session, form-session-delegation, x402-execute, kite-discovery, shopping, wallet-send, cloud-deploy, manage-agents, activity, upgrade-passport, report-feedback, kite-passport
- **Flow:** authenticate → create session → execute paid API requests through x402
- **40+ agent platforms** supported (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, etc.)
- **Multi-chain:** base, tempo, solana, robinhood
- **Shopping skill:** Full headless Amazon shopping with crypto checkout
- **Cloud deploy:** One-command GCP provisioning + Cloud Run
- **User auth:** Email OTP, JWT, passkey support
- **GenTech comparison:** Kite is a polished paid-API marketplace + shopping platform. GenTech is self-hosted x402 infrastructure + agent framework with gaming, CAD, freelancing, and cryptographic receipts. Complementary, not competitive.
- **GenTech advantages over Kite:** Q402 Trust Receipts (cryptographic ECDSA), Paymenter x402 Extension (hosting billing), ClawWork (agents earn money), Agent Warfare/Arcade (gaming), CAD Viewer (text-to-cad), self-hosted gateway (19/19 validator checks), Hermes integration, Google ADK x402 contribution
- **Kite advantages over GenTech:** Paid API catalog (100+ services), Amazon shopping, cloud deploy, user auth, activity feed, CLI auto-upgrade, virtual cards, cross-chain auto-routing
- **Contribution ideas:** (1) Q402 Trust Receipts → add cryptographic verification to Kite's receipt model, (2) Self-hosted gateway → package as Kite-compatible merchant backend, (3) ClawWork as a Kite skill, (4) Arcade as a Kite merchant, (5) CAD as a Kite service, (6) Hermes skill for Kite Passport (built at github.com/Gentech-Labs/gentech-kite-passport), (7) Cross-chain routing knowledge sharing
- **Decision: Contribute + Integrate** — Hermes skill for Kite Passport built and pushed. PR to Kite's repo blocked (forking restricted). Jordan needs to open PR from Gentech-Labs/gentech-kite-passport to gokite-ai/passport-skills.
- **Fork blocked:** Kite's repo has forking restricted (HTTP 403). Cannot create fork via API. Workaround: standalone repo at github.com/Gentech-Labs/gentech-kite-passport, PR must come from Jordan's account.

**Arc / ArcLens (arclenz.xyz) deep dive (Jul 18, 2026):**
- **Arc blockchain** — Circle's L1, USDC-native gas ($0.001 flat), 0.5s blocks, Chain 5042002 (testnet live)
- **ArcLens** — ecosystem hub + Lens AI (ERC-8004 agent #842439, pays builders via x402)
- **Lens AI** — first AI that pays builders it cites. Already supports x402 payments. $0.32 paid across 445 citations
- **Programmable Money Hackathon** — Encode Club, started Jul 13, 7 weeks remaining. Requires functional MVP
- **Circle Developer Grants** — focus #1: "Agentic economic activity" (our x402 fits perfectly). Up to USDC funding, milestone-based
- 302 projects building on Arc — DEXes saturated, **zero x402 gateways**, no token security tools
- **Decision: Enter hackathon + apply for Circle Grant** — First x402 gateway on Arc, Lens AI integration for auto-revenue
- See `references/arc-ecosystem-jul-2026.md` for full details

**Livestock/Agriculture RWA (Jul 24, 2026) — Brazil tokenized cows / US entry research:**
- Brazil's B3 exchange tokenized 10 dairy cows as loan collateral via Cowmed (smart collars, 100K cows tracked)
- US players: CattleProof (USDA blockchain verification) + BlockTrust (EID traceability, hiring Solidity dev, seeking partnerships)
- Gap: identity/traceability layer exists in US; DeFi/collateral layer does not — that's our slot
- BlockTrust is the best entry point (actively hiring Solidity dev, seeking partners, small team)
- See `references/livestock-rwa-tokenization-jul-2026.md` for full company profiles, contacts, and numbers

**x402 Foundation (Linux Foundation) — deep dive (Jul 19, 2026):**

- **Structure:** x402 is now an official Linux Foundation project (LF Projects, LLC). Open standard for internet-native payments.
- **40+ member organizations** at operational launch (Jul 2026): Ripple, NEAR, Quant, Cloudflare, Coinbase, AWS, Amex, Mastercard, Stripe, Visa, Circle, Google, Shopify, Solana Foundation, Stellar, Adyen, Fiserv, Monad, MoonPay, Nansen, Alchemy, Messari, QuickNode, Vercel, World.
- **Core protocol repo:** `github.com/x402-foundation/x402` — 6.4k⭐, 1.8k forks, 309 contributors, 1,033 commits. TypeScript/Python/Go/Solidity. Has `.agents/skills` directory.
- **Traction:** 75.41M transactions, $24.24M volume, 94K buyers, 22K sellers in the last 30 days (per x402.org).
- **Cloudflare integration:** Cloudflare's Agents SDK has `withX402()` for MCP tool payment gating. Deferred payment scheme proposed for batch/delayed settlement. X402 playground at playground.x402.cloudflare.com.

- **NEAR:** Joined x402 Foundation for agentic economy infrastructure. NEAR Intents for agent settlement. $38.4M revenue, 30% of fees as revenue. Deflationary trajectory.
- **Quant:** Overledger API — connects to 30+ platforms (AWS, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, OpenAI, Slack, Teams, etc.). Positioned as the "conduit" connecting all agentic payment infrastructure.
- **Decision: Contribute to x402 protocol + Integrate XRPL support** — We have a production x402 gateway (rare among foundation members). Submit x402 agent patterns to core repo, port gateway to XRPL/RLUSD. Join foundation Slack (slack.x402.org) for networking.
- See `references/x402-foundation-jul-2026.md` when created.
- See `references/game-studio-agent-economy-jul-2026.md` — Game engine MCP/x402 ecosystem research. Covers Unity CLI, Unreal Engine agent tooling, Godot MCP, Claude Code Game Studio, and x402+MCP payment standard. Weekly tracking template included.
