# Cycle 1 Bootstrap — 2026-07-27

## Context

The harness was bootstrapped on 2026-07-26 with a constitution, state file, critique log, and recommendation placeholder — but no execution loop, no witness evidence, no predictions, and no way to run cycles. It was a static directory, not a running system.

## What was created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `execution-loop.sh` | Core evolution runner with 4 modes (evolve/critique/verify/garden) |
| `witness-log.md` | 3 evidence entries with timestamps, sources, and evidence |
| `predictions.md` | 2 falsifiable predictions with falsification criteria |
| `execution-log.md` | Cycle 1 record of what was done and the result |

## What was updated

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `recommendation.md` | From placeholder to full RECOMMENDED_ACTION/CONFIDENCE/REASONING |
| `harness-state.md` | From "Not yet active" to "Active — Cycle 1 completed" |

## Key findings

1. **Path mismatch**: The original skill documented `${PROFILE_DIR}/harness/` but the actual harness lives at `/root/.hermes/harness/`. Always verify with `ls` before referencing paths.
2. **No cron trigger**: The harness has no cron entry. It only runs when manually invoked.
3. **Single-agent design works**: The four-role plan (Evolution/Critic/Verifier/Gardener) was aspirational. The current deployment runs as a single cron job that handles all roles in one pass, which is simpler and sufficient.

## Execution result

```
=== Harness Cycle 1 — 2026-07-27 08:02 UTC ===
[evolve] Constitution OK (v1.0)
[evolve] Witness log has 3 entries
[evolve] Cycle 1 complete — no friction found
=== Cycle 1 finished ===
```

## Predictions fulfilled

- Prediction 1 ✅: `execution-loop.sh evolve` exited 0 with cycle-completion output
- Prediction 2 ✅: witness-log.md has 3 entries with timestamps/sources/evidence
