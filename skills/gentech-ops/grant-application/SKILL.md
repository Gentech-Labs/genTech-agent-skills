# Grant Application — Structured Drafting

**Purpose:** Draft competitive grant applications for ecosystem funding programs with clear narrative, measurable impact, and concrete deliverables.

---

## When to Use

- **Ecosystem grant programs** (Avalanche, Ethereum Foundation, Solana, protocol grants)
- **Accelerator applications** (RetroPGF, Gitcoin Grants, specific chain programs)
- **Builder funding opportunities** (DeFi Foundation, protocol grant programs)
- **User says:** "Draft a grant application," "Apply for X grant," "We should sign up for Y funding"

---

## Core Philosophy: Ship First

**Most applications fail because:** They pitch what they *will* build, not what they *have* built.

**Ship-first narrative:**
1. **What we've already shipped** (proof of execution)
2. **What the grant unlocks** (acceleration, not starting)
3. **Community benefit** (how ecosystem wins)
4. **Timeline + deliverables** (concrete, not vague)

**Example:**

❌ **Weak:** "We're building an agent economy ecosystem on Avalanche. With $30K, we can deploy smart contracts and build APIs."

✅ **Strong:** "We've shipped 48 live x402 endpoints and deployed ERC-8004 agent identity on Avalanche C-Chain. With $30K, we accelerate deployment of 3 revenue APIs ($33k/yr potential) and release open-source Agent Kit v2 (enables 100+ agent builders)."

**Difference:** Weak application is hypothetical. Strong application proves you ship and shows what funding *accelerates*.

## Application Structure

### 1. Project Overview (150-200 words)

**What it answers:** Who are you, what are you building, why this grant?

**Components:**
- **Name + One-sentence summary** (what you're building)
- **Team info** (who you are, location, availability)
- **Tech stack** (what you use to build)
- **Why this chain/protocol** (why Avalanche, why this ecosystem)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Project Overview

**Name:** Agent-to-Agent Economy (AAE) on Avalanche

**Summary:** We're building the infrastructure for AI agents to transact autonomously. Our x402 payment gateway enables AI agents to pay each other directly via Avalanche C-Chain, creating a new economy where agents are economic actors.

**Team:** GenTech Labs — Jordan Jones (Founder, Developer). Located in Cincinnati, OH (Remote). Available 25+ hours/week immediately.

**Tech Stack:** Rust, Python, Cloudflare Workers, Avalanche JSON-RPC

**Why Avalanche:** Sub-second finality, multi-chain support, strong builder community, low transaction fees for high-volume agent payments.
```

---

### 2. Problem Statement (100-150 words)

**What it answers:** What's broken, who's affected, why it matters now?

**Components:**
- **Clear problem** (what's not working)
- **Who's affected** (users, builders, ecosystem)
- **Impact** (consequences if not solved)
- **Why now** (timing urgency)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Problem Statement

AI agents are trapped in "human-in-the-loop" transactions. They can read data, analyze markets, and make decisions—but they can't pay for services, buy compute, or transact with each other. Every transaction requires a human to sign a wallet.

**Impact:**
- Agents can't scale autonomously
- Economic activity is bottlenecked by human attention
- AI remains a tool, not a participant

**Why now:** AI agents are exploding. Autonomous commerce will be the next wave of Web3. Avalanche can lead if we build the infrastructure today.
```

---

### 3. Solution Overview (200-250 words)

**What it answers:** How do you solve it, what have you already built, what makes it real?

**Components:**
- **Core solution** (how you fix the problem)
- **What's already shipped** (proof of execution)
- **Why this approach works** (technical validation)
- **Key components** (what makes it complete)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Solution Overview

**Core Solution:** AAE Stack + x402 Payment Gateway

**What we've shipped:**
- ✅ x402 gateway live and operational (https://api.gentechlabs.net — verified 2026-09-30, 14 services)
- ✅ Enforces 402 Payment Required on paid APIs
- ✅ Routes payments to Avalanche C-Chain wallets
- ✅ Integrates with Coinbase Commerce (x402.org protocol)
- ✅ Agent Kit v1.1 (open source, MIT)
- ✅ 16 paid endpoints ready for monetization

**How it works:**
1. AI agent requests data via x402 gateway
2. Gateway returns `402 Payment Required` with Avalanche address
3. Agent pays AVAX via x402 protocol
4. Gateway validates transaction and returns data

**Key components:**
- **x402 Payment Gateway** — Enforces payments, routes transactions
- **Agent Kit** — Open-source agent starter kit with x402 pre-configured
- **Agent Search & Registration APIs** — Registry for autonomous agents
```

---

### 4. Impact & Metrics (150-200 words)

**What it answers:** What will change, how will you measure it, why does the ecosystem care?

**Components:**
- **Short-term metrics** (3 months, what's achievable)
- **Long-term metrics** (12 months, what's the vision)
- **Ecosystem benefit** (how chain/protocol wins)
- **Measurable outcomes** (specific numbers, not vague claims)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Impact & Metrics

**Short-term (3 months):**
- **10+** new agents deployed on Avalanche
- **1,000+** x402 transactions via AVAX
- **5+** developers using Agent Kit

**Long-term (12 months):**
- **50+** agents in AAE ecosystem
- **50,000+** monthly transactions
- **$10,000+** monthly transaction fees (shared with Avalanche)

**Ecosystem benefit:**
- **More agents = more transaction volume** for Avalanche
- **x402 payments = on-chain revenue** for protocols
- **Agent Kit = lowers barrier to entry** for builders
- **Open source = community contribution**

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Transaction volume via on-chain analytics
- Agent count via Agent Registry API
- GitHub stars/contributors for Agent Kit
- Monthly transaction fees (split with Avalanche)
```

---

### 5. Use of Funds (200-250 words)

**What it answers:** How will you spend the money, why each line item matters, what's the ROI?

**Components:**
- **Line-item breakdown** (specific amounts, not vague categories)
- **Justification** (why each expense matters)
- **Timeline alignment** (how spending maps to deliverables)
- **Return on investment** (what the ecosystem gets back)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Use of Funds

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Development** | $12,000 | x402 security audit, Agent Kit v2.0 |
| **Integration** | $8,000 | Deepen Avalanche C-Chain integration, testnet scaling |
| **Marketing** | $6,000 | Developer outreach, hackathon prizes, tutorials |
| **Operations** | $4,000 | VPS hosting, Cloudflare Workers, tooling |

**Justification:**
- **Development:** Security audit builds trust, Agent Kit v2 lowers barrier to entry
- **Integration:** C-Chain deep-dive ensures reliability at scale
- **Marketing:** Developer outreach + hackathon prizes = more builders using Avalanche
- **Operations:** VPS + Workers = always-on infrastructure, no downtime

**ROI for Avalanche:**
- **$30K investment** → **$10K+ monthly transaction fees** (shared)
- **50+ agents deployed** → **50,000+ monthly transactions** → **TVL growth**
- **Open source Agent Kit** → **100+ builders** → **Ecosystem expansion**

**Spending timeline:** All funds spent within 3 months, tied to deliverables (see timeline below).
```

---

### 6. Timeline (200-250 words)

**What it answers:** When will things happen, what are the checkpoints, how will you report progress?

**Components:**
- **Phased breakdown** (Month 1, 2, 3 or Week 1-8)
- **Checkpoints** (specific deliverables, not vague progress)
- **Reporting cadence** (how you'll communicate)
- **Milestone validation** (how grant program can verify)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Timeline

**Month 1:**
- Complete security audit of x402 gateway
- Launch Avalanche-specific developer tutorial
- Deploy 5 example agents on C-Chain
- **Checkpoint:** Audit report + tutorial live on GitHub

**Month 2:**
- Agent Kit v2.0 with Avalanche presets
- Run Avalanche AAE hackathon (prize pool $2,000)
- Integrate with Avalanche DEXs (Trader Joe, Joe Pairs)
- **Checkpoint:** Agent Kit v2 released + hackathon complete

**Month 3:**
- Public launch of AAE on Avalanche
- Measure and report economic activity
- Open source all Avalanche-specific components
- **Checkpoint:** Launch report + GitHub repos open

**Reporting:**
- Weekly updates on GitHub (commits, issues, milestones)
- Monthly report to grant program (metrics, blockers, progress)
- Final report at Month 3 (all deliverables verified)

**Verification:**
- Audit report (third-party security firm)
- GitHub repos (public, tagged releases)
- On-chain analytics (transaction volume, agent count)
- Developer testimonials (Agent Kit adoption)
```

---

### 7. Why Us (100-150 words)

**What it answers:** Why should they fund you, what makes you the right team, what's your track record?

**Components:**
- **Proof of ship** (what you've already delivered)
- **Technical credibility** (why you can execute)
- **Ecosystem alignment** (why you care about this specific chain/protocol)
- **Commitment** (how much time, what you're willing to put in)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Why Us

We're not just "proposing"—we're **shipping**.

**Delivered:**
- ✅ x402 gateway live and enforcing payments
- ✅ Agent Kit v1.1 shipped
- ✅ 12+ APIs ready for monetization
- ✅ Cross-chain support (Avalanche, Base, Solana)

**Next:**
- Avalanche-first developer experience
- Economic activity tracking dashboard
- Partnership with Avalanche ecosystem projects

**Commitment:** 25+ hours/week immediately, scaling to 40+ after leaving Amazon. We build fast, we ship frequently, we contribute back to the ecosystem.
```

---

### 8. Conclusion (50-100 words)

**What it answers:** What's the vision, why does this matter now, what's the call to action?

**Components:**
- **Vision statement** (one-sentence future)
- **Urgency** (why this matters now)
- **Grant impact** (what the funding accelerates)
- **Call to action** (what's next)

**Example:**
```markdown
### Conclusion

AI agents are the next wave of users on Avalanche. By enabling autonomous transactions via x402 and Avalanche C-Chain, we're building the infrastructure for a new economy—one where agents are economic actors, not just tools.

**$30,000 accelerates this vision by 6 months.**

Let's build the agent economy on Avalanche.
```

## Grant Program Research

### Before Applying: Know the Program

**Research checklist:**
- [ ] Program website (read guidelines, eligibility, deadlines)
- [ ] Previous winners (what they built, how they positioned)
- [ ] Selection criteria (what matters to reviewers)
- [ ] Budget requirements (max amount, cost-share requirements)
- [ ] Deliverables required (reports, demos, open source)
- [ ] Reviewer demographics (technical, ecosystem, business?)

**Key questions:**
- **Who reviews applications?** (Technical devs vs ecosystem managers vs VCs)
- **What do they care about most?** (Shipping vs vision vs ecosystem impact vs open source)
- **What's the acceptance rate?** (Competitive vs straightforward)
- **What's the typical grant size?** (Are we asking for too much or too little?)

### Fit Scoring (4-5 star bar)

When Jordan asks "what's a 4-5 star grant?", score each candidate against these five gates — a grant must clear ALL to be a 4-star, and be open-now + already-have-the-live-product to be a 5-star:

1. **Stack fit** — x402, agent economy, DeFi, Base/Solana/Avalanche (our live rails)
2. **Individual-friendly** — no C-corp (Jordan is unincorporated)
3. **Open now** — not a "watch for next window"
4. **Non-dilutive** — no equity, no strings
5. **Realistic path to win** — we can actually meet the requirements

**5-star = open now + pays for x402/agent-economy middleware + we already have the live product to show.** Circle Developer Grants (x402/Arc/Programmable Wallets = our lane) is the canonical 5-star; Optimism Retro (retroactive for live Base usage) is the strongest open 4-star.

### The "Catch" — find the real gate before scoring

Every grant page advertises an amount and "open" status, but the REAL fit is decided by a hidden deployment/community requirement. Read the eligibility section for the gate, not the headline:

- **"Building on [chain] tools" + "active in [chain] community"** → requires a native build + community presence, not a port. A port is a checkbox; a native build is a 3-month commitment. (Starknet Seed Grants pattern.)
- **"Working deployment on [chain] mainnet" + "verifiable onchain activity"** → requires a real deploy with live usage, verified by the grant team. (Prezenti Frontier Pool pattern.)
- **"Added to [registry] first" + onchain-data evaluation algorithm** → rewards real usage over time, not a submit-and-wait. (Optimism OP Atlas pattern.)

**EVM-compatibility heuristic:** when a grant requires a chain deployment, prefer EVM-compatible chains (Celo, Base, Avalanche, etc.) — our x402 gateway ports cheaply. A non-EVM chain (Starknet/Cairo, Solana/Rust) is a whole new toolchain and a much higher cost to qualify. This is often the deciding factor between two otherwise-equal grants.

**When the catch is a real deploy, say so honestly** — don't let the grant amount mask the qualification cost. Log the catch in the Green Room entry alongside the fit score so the go/no-go decision is teed up, not deferred.

---

## Positioning Strategies

### Strategy 1: "Ship First" (Proven builders)

**When:** You have live deployments, open-source work, demonstrated traction.

**Narrative:**
- "We've already shipped X, Y, Z"
- "This grant accelerates X, not starts it"
- "Here's live proof you can verify today"

**Works for:** Avalanche Builder Program, Ethereum Foundation, protocol teams

**Avoid:** Vague "we're building X" statements without proof.

---

### Strategy 2: "Ecosystem Builder" (Community focus)

**When:** You have open-source tools, developer education, ecosystem contributions.

**Narrative:**
- "We're lowering the barrier to entry for builders"
- "Our open-source work enables 100+ builders"
- "Grant funding = ecosystem expansion, not just our project"

**Works for:** Solana Foundation, Base Ecosystem Fund, protocol grant programs

**Avoid:** Focusing only on your project's revenue/growth.

---

### Strategy 3: "Technical Deep Dive" (Infrastructure focus)

**When:** You're building technical infrastructure, protocols, or tooling.

**Narrative:**
- "We're solving hard technical problem X"
- "Here's our approach, here's why it works"
- "We've validated with prototype/benchmarks"

**Works for:** Ethereum Research, Chainlink Community Grants, technical-focused programs

**Avoid:** Oversimplifying technical challenges.

---

### Strategy 4: "Become the Standard Rail" (Infrastructure positioning)

**When:** Your product is a protocol, payment rail, compliance layer, or middleware that other projects depend on.

**Narrative:**
- "We're not just building a product — we're building the standard rail that the entire ecosystem routes through"
- "Chainlink didn't become the standard oracle by building a better DeFi protocol. They built the rail that every protocol needed."
- "The CLARITY Act makes compliance mandatory. Most of the ecosystem isn't ready. We are — and we're providing the compliance rail everyone will need."

**Key elements:**
- **Layer 0 mindset** — Your product isn't the application layer, it's the infrastructure layer beneath all applications
- **Ecosystem listing strategy** — Get listed everywhere agents discover services (awesome-* repos, marketplaces, registries). Each listing is a permanent entry point
- **Open-source the reference** — Ship reference implementations so other teams build on your standard
- **Regulatory alignment** — If you're in a regulated space (payments, compliance), lead with that. It's a moat, not a liability

**Works for:** x402 protocol, CLARITY Act compliance, payment rails, identity registries, oracle services

**Avoid:** Positioning a user-facing app as a "standard rail" unless it genuinely has network effects and switching costs.

---

## Accelerator Applications (Cohort-Based Programs)

A distinct category from grants — accelerators invest **equity or SAFE**, run **fixed-duration cohorts** (8-12 weeks), include **in-person onboarding**, and require a **founder video**. They fund the founder, not just the project.

### How Accelerators Differ from Grants

| Dimension | Grant | Accelerator |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Instrument** | Grant (no equity) | SAFE / equity investment ($250K-$1M+) |
| **Duration** | Self-paced | Fixed cohort (8-12 weeks) |
| **Format** | Remote | Hybrid (2 weeks in-person + remote) |
| **Application** | Written form | Written form + founder video |
| **Selection** | Proposal quality | Founder + traction + network fit |
| **Deliverables** | Technical milestones | Demo Day pitch |
| **Network** | Minimal | Structured mentorship + alumni community |
| **Funding** | Smaller ($10K-$100K) | Larger ($250K-$1M+) |

### Founder Video Requirements

Most top accelerators (Alliance, YC) require a founder video. This is often the blocker that stops solo founders from applying.

**Format:** 60-90 seconds, shot on phone, no professional equipment needed.

**Script structure:**

| Time | Content |
|------|---------|
| 0:00-0:15 | **Opening** — "Hi, I'm [name], founder of [company]. We built [one-sentence: what and why it matters]" |
| 0:15-0:35 | **Demo** — Show something LIVE on screen (terminal curl, dashboard, working endpoint) |
| 0:35-0:55 | **Traction** — Shipped X, Y, Z live (numbers, chains, users, repositories) |
| 0:55-1:15 | **Vision** — Where the market is going, what the funding unlocks |
| 1:15-1:30 | **Close** — "Let's build [vision]" |

**Rules:** Show live product > slides. Numbers > adjectives ("16 endpoints across 6 chains" > "multi-chain platform"). Solo technical founders emphasize shipping velocity. Authenticity > production value.

### SPC Founder Fellowship (Fall 2026 — $1M, 7% SAFE on Money Only)

**Program:** South Park Commons (southparkcommons.com) — Founder Fellowship
**Deal:** $1M capital + full SPC membership (community, partners, offices, programming)
**Structure:** $400K upfront for 7% on a standard SAFE — **7% on that money only, not the company**. + $600K guaranteed next round.
**Net after taxes (Ohio, single, $795 rent):** ~$276K (Federal ~$95K, FICA ~$15K, Ohio state ~$14K)
**Runway at $1,700/mo total burn:** 12+ years
**Duration:** 8-week bootcamp (in SF) + open-ended residency
**Deadline:** August 2, 2026
**Portfolio:** Baseten, Luma AI, Gamma, Render — all infrastructure plays

**Key differences from Alliance/YC:**
- **7% on the money only** — not 7% of the company. They get 7% upside on their $400K investment, not a perpetual ownership stake. This is the critical distinction most solo founders miss: the SAFE is attached to that specific $400K, not the entire company valuation.
- **Tax math matters:** $400K gross → ~$276K net in Ohio. At $1,700/mo burn (rent $795 + bills), that is 12+ years of full-time building. Jordan can quit Amazon immediately and still have years of runway.
- **8-week SF bootcamp:** Feasible with funds for cat sitter, travel, and living. Not a blocker at this funding level.
- **Solo founder bias:** SPC prefers builders who can prototype alone. No co-founder required.
- **No specific industry** — they backed foundation models, chip hardware, space tech, quantum, robotics.

**Application strategy:**
1. **Lead with the 57.5% stat** — "Cloudflare reports bots now generate 57.5% of global web traffic. The internet's majority is no longer human. But payment infrastructure was built for humans."
2. **Show what's live** — x402 gateway, Q402 gasless, self-evolution harness, agent kit — all open-source, all working
3. **Position as infrastructure** — "We're building the operating system for the majority of the internet"
4. **Solo founder narrative** — "I don't need a co-founder to prototype. I need capital to go full-time and make this the standard."

**⚠️ The live form is SHORTER than the narrative draft (verified Aug 1, 2026):** the Airtable form at `southparkcommons.com/apply` (embed `airtable.com/embed/appxDXHfPCZvb75qk/pag8h6Xe52XNke3ai/form`) has ONLY these fields:
1. Which best describes where you are in your journey today? (dropdown)
2. Full Name · 3. Email · 4. Phone number · 5. LinkedIn profile · 6. Where will you be based? (dropdown) · 7. How did you hear about the application? (listbox) + 8. elaborate
9. Proudest achievement (<1000 chars, link required) · 10. 2-3 artifacts · 11. Stay in touch checkbox · 12. Anything else to add (optional)

There are NO separate team / funding / problem-space / why-you fields. Map the strongest draft answers to fields 9-10; use field 12 sparingly for one extra pitch line. The old multi-section draft (Q3-Q6) does NOT map to this form — do not pad it in. Always verify the actual live form fields before drafting narrative; accelerator forms are often shorter than grant forms.

**Pitch paragraph:**
> *"Cloudflare just confirmed what we've been building for — bots now generate 57.5% of global web traffic. The internet's majority is no longer human. But the infrastructure — payments, identity, spending limits — was built for humans. Credit cards, bank accounts, wallets with seed phrases. None of it works when an agent needs to pay another agent at 3am with no human in the loop. That's what we built. x402 payment rails, Q402 gasless settlement, self-evolving agent governance — all open-source, all agent-native. We're not building for the human internet. We're building for the majority internet."*

### Alliance Accelerator (Live Application, Jul 2026)

**Program:** Alliance (alliance.xyz) — ALL18 cohort
**Deal:** $500K upon admission + $500K follow-on at seed
**Duration:** 10 weeks (2 weeks in-person NYC + 8 remote)
**Deadline:** July 22, 2026 (regular admission)
**Start:** September 7, 2026
**Median outcome:** $3.5M raised at $25M post after Demo Day

**What they look for:** Technical founders, pre-product accepted, crypto/AI/fintech, solo founders OK. "The only thing we care about: you want to build something big and your team can ship."

**Notable alumni:** Pump, Pendle, Synthetix, Tensor, Caldera

**Application drafted Jul 17, 2026** — in `09-Green Room/alliance-application-draft.md`

### Application Strategy for Accelerators

1. **Lead with what's live** — accelerators want proof of shipping, not polished decks
2. **Match their portfolio language** — if they back "crypto AI," frame as "agent economy infrastructure"
3. **Show, don't tell** — live links, GitHub repos, deployed endpoints in the application
4. **Founder video is non-negotiable** — plan for it, don't let it be the blocker
5. **Apply early** — many accelerators have rolling review within the window

## Product Angle Selection

### Matching Product to Grant Criteria

| Grant Program | Best Product Angle | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Avalanche ($30K)** | AAE / x402 | Broad impact, agent economy on Avalanche |
| **Avalanche ($10K)** | DeFi Intelligence API | Direct Avalanche integration, LP tooling |
| **Ethereum Foundation** | Open-source tools | Ethereum ecosystem contribution |
| **Solana Foundation** | High-performance agents | Solana speed advantage for agent transactions |
| **Protocol grants** | Specific integration | Solves protocol's specific problem |

**Session 2026-07-06: Avalanche Grants Example**

**What happened:**
- User shared X post: Avalanche has two grants ($30K, $10K)
- Gentech drafted two applications:
  1. AAE Stack ($30K) — broad impact, agent economy
  2. DeFi Intelligence API ($10K) — direct Avalanche integration

**Key learning:** Different grant sizes → different product angles. $30K requires broad impact; $10K requires focused, concrete deliverables.

---

## Budget Writing Patterns

### Line-Item Best Practices

**1. Be specific, not vague**

❌ **Weak:** "Development work" ($5,000)
✅ **Strong:** "x402 security audit by third-party firm" ($5,000)

**2. Justify every expense**

❌ **Weak:** "Marketing" ($3,000)
✅ **Strong:** "Developer outreach + hackathon prizes ($2,000) + tutorials ($1,000)" ($3,000)

**3. Align spending with deliverables**

❌ **Weak:** "Operations" ($4,000) — no timeline alignment
✅ **Strong:** "VPS hosting + Cloudflare Workers for 3-month deployment phase" ($4,000)

**4. Show ROI for the ecosystem**

❌ **Weak:** Just listing expenses
✅ **Strong:** "$30K → $10K+ monthly fees + 50+ agents + ecosystem expansion"

---

### Common Budget Line Items

| Category | Line Item | Justification |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Development** | Security audit | Builds trust, required for production |
| **Development** | Features/milestones | Accelerates roadmap |
| **Integration** | Chain/protocol integration | Deep-dive ensures reliability |
| **Integration** | Testnet deployment | Validates before mainnet |
| **Marketing** | Developer outreach | More builders using ecosystem |
| **Marketing** | Hackathon prizes | Generates projects/traffic |
| **Marketing** | Tutorials/documentation | Lowers barrier to entry |
| **Operations** | VPS/hosting | Always-on infrastructure |
| **Operations** | Cloudflare Workers/CDN | Global distribution |
| **Operations** | Tooling/licenses | Improves developer productivity |

---

## Timeline Writing Patterns

### Checkpoint Best Practices

**1. Specific deliverables, not vague progress**

❌ **Weak:** "Make progress on x402 gateway"
✅ **Strong:** "Complete security audit of x402 gateway + publish audit report"

**2. Verifiable outcomes**

❌ **Weak:** "Improve Agent Kit"
✅ **Strong:** "Agent Kit v2.0 released + 5 example agents deployed on C-Chain"

**3. Reporting cadence**

❌ **Weak:** "We'll update you"
✅ **Strong:** "Weekly updates on GitHub, monthly report to grant program"

---

### Example Timeline Phases

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Audit + tutorial + examples
- Checkpoint: Public deliverables

**Month 2: Expansion**
- v2.0 features + hackathon + partnerships
- Checkpoint: Live product + community event

**Month 3: Launch**
- Public launch + reporting + open source
- Checkpoint: Final report + all deliverables verified

## Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "We're Building X" Without Proof

**Symptom:** Application focuses on what you *will* build, not what you *have* built.

**Impact:** Reviewers assume vaporware.

**Fix:** Lead with "What we've shipped" section. Use live links, deployed endpoints, GitHub repos.

---

### Pitfall 2: Vague Metrics

**Symptom:** "We'll increase adoption" or "We'll grow the ecosystem."

**Impact:** No way to verify success.

**Fix:** Use specific numbers: "10+ agents deployed," "1,000+ transactions," "5+ developers using Agent Kit."

---

### Pitfall 3: Budget Not Aligned with Deliverables

**Symptom:** Line items that don't match timeline phases.

**Impact:** Reviewers question how money will be spent.

**Fix:** Map each budget item to a timeline checkpoint. Show ROI.

---

### Pitfall 4: Focusing on Your Revenue, Not Ecosystem Benefit

**Symptom:** Application talks about how you'll make money, not how ecosystem wins.

**Impact:** Grant programs fund ecosystem growth, not your startup.

**Fix:** Shift focus: "How does Avalanche benefit?" "How does this help builders?"

---

### Pitfall 5: Generic Applications for Different Programs

**Symptom:** Same application for Avalanche, Ethereum Foundation, Solana.

**Impact:** Shows you don't understand each program's specific criteria.

**Fix:** Tailor each application:
- Avalanche → focus on C-Chain, Trader Joe, builder community
- Ethereum Foundation → focus on open source, developer tools
- Solana Foundation → focus on speed, low fees, ecosystem projects

---

### Pitfall 6: No Timeline or Checkpoints

**Symptom:** "We'll deliver in 3 months" with no breakdown.

**Impact:** Reviewers can't track progress.

**Fix:** Phase-by-phase breakdown with specific deliverables and verification steps.

---

### Pitfall 7: Not Researching the Program

**Symptom:** Application doesn't reference program guidelines, criteria, or previous winners.

**Impact:** Shows lack of due diligence.

**Fix:** Read program website, study previous winners, mention specific program goals.

---

### Pitfall 8: Broken Links in the Application (esp. GitHub URLs)

**Symptom:** Application references repos/pages that 404 — checked only by memory, not by live fetch.

**Impact:** Reviewers click a link, hit 404, and the "ship first" proof evaporates. A broken link is worse than no link.

**Fix:** Before submitting, verify EVERY link with a live HTTP check:
```bash
for u in "https://api.gentechlabs.net" "https://github.com/Gentech-Labs/agent-credit-score" "https://gentechlabs.net"; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 10 "$u"); echo "$code  $u"
done
```
Expect 200. Flag 404/301 and swap in a working URL before the user pastes.

**GenTech-specific (verified Aug 1, 2026):**
- `github.com/Gentech-Labs/genTech-agent-kit` → **404 on web** (flagged account). Use `github.com/Gentech-Labs/genTech-agent-kit` (org copy, public).
- `ProtoJay4789.github.io` → **404** — GitHub Pages is not serving. Do NOT link portfolio/dashboard pages there until fixed.
- Working: `api.gentechlabs.net`, `gentechlabs.net`, `github.com/Gentech-Labs/agent-credit-score`.
- Rule: for SPC/grant artifact fields, always use `Gentech-Labs/<repo>` links and re-verify before pasting — the artifact text and the link must both be in the final paste block.

### Pitfall 9: Not Matching Draft Narrative to the LIVE Form

**Symptom:** Drafting a rich multi-section narrative (team/funding/problem-space/why-you) when the actual application form only has 12 fields.

**Fix:** Always `browser_navigate` the live form URL first (Airtable embeds return only a shell via web_extract). Map the strongest draft answers to the fields that actually exist; keep surplus as "Anything else to add?" candidates. Accelerator/fellowship forms are often shorter than grant forms — SPC Fall 2026 had no team/funding fields at all.

### Pitfall 10: Prep documented but submission record never saved (recovered later)

**Symptom:** The grant-application skill's Session History documents the *prep* (field-by-field mapping, narrative, "paste-ready text in vault"), but the actual **submission tracker file is never created at submit time**. Weeks later a status email arrives ("thank you for applying... under review") and the agent can't find the application record — it has to reverse-engineer the submission from session history.

**Impact:** The application "vanishes" from the vault. When the program emails a status update, we can't confirm what we applied for, the amount, or the timeline. This bit us on the **Team1 Mini Grant (Aug 6, 2026)** — the July 9 prep was documented but no `Treasury/2026-08-06-team1-mini-grant.md` existed until I created it after the status email.

**Fix:** Create the tracker entry **the moment the application is submitted**, not after. Proven shape (see `Treasury/2026-08-06-team1-mini-grant.md`):
- Path: `Treasury/YYYY-MM-DD-<program>-grant.md` (or `00-HQ/grant-program-name.md`)
- Fields: date tracked, source/URL, status (SUBMITTED / UNDER REVIEW), type, timeline, what we applied with, action items (watch inbox, follow-up date, keep work live)
- Set a follow-up cron (~2 weeks out) so a silent program doesn't get forgotten
- Commit to the vault immediately

**Rule:** Prep ≠ submission. The skill documents how to draft; the tracker is a separate artifact that must be created at submit time. If you've submitted and there's no tracker file, create it before the session ends.

- [ ] Timeline has phases and checkpoints
- [ ] "Why us" section shows track record
- [ ] Conclusion ties to vision + grant impact
- [ ] Tailored to specific grant program
- [ ] Proofread for clarity and conciseness

**After submitting:**
- [ ] **Create the tracker file NOW** (`Treasury/YYYY-MM-DD-<program>-grant.md`) — status SUBMITTED, what we applied with, follow-up date. Do NOT wait for a status email. (See Pitfall 10.)
- [ ] Set a follow-up cron (~2 weeks out) so a silent program isn't forgotten
- [ ] Save application to vault (00-HQ/grant-program-name.md)
- [ ] Track application status (submitted, under review, rejected, funded)
- [ ] Prepare follow-up if accepted (reporting cadence)
- [ ] Apply learnings to next application

### Solana Foundation USA Grants + Agentic Engineering Grants

See `references/solana-grant-workflow.md` for the complete application flow for both programs, including the mandatory solana.new workflow (unique to Agentic Engineering Grants).

## Session History

**August 5, 2026 — Superteam Agentic Engineering Grant TRANCH 1 RECEIVED (100 USDG):**

- **Status:** ✅ Tranche 1 (100 USDG) received post-KYC. Tranche 2 (100 USDG) pending on shipping.
- **Tranche-2 unlock requirements (the real "second half" — verified from the Earn listing):**
  1. **Live, working product/MVP** at the time of the second-tranche application
  2. **Some Solana integration** in scope (mandatory — this is the differentiator requirement)
  3. **Coding subscription receipt(s) totaling $200** — upload to the tranche-2 form. This is what "keep subscriptions auto-covered" maps to: you must *document* $200 in coding subs (model providers, dev tools) to unlock the second tranche. Budget for these as a real deliverable, not overhead.
  4. Project URL + GitHub repo
- **Payout cadence:** approvals on Mondays, paid by Friday of the same week.
- **Payment token:** USDG on Solana (Paxos SPL token). USDG is natively on Ethereum, Solana, Ink, X Layer — if the balance is in a MetaMask Solana wallet, **swap USDG→USDC is a simple ~1:1 stablecoin swap on Jupiter, no bridge needed** (both live on Solana). Don't assume a bridge; verify the chain first.
- **Sequencing insight:** a hackathon build with Solana rails (e.g. the Agentic Treasury, which already has a SOL quote leg) can double as the tranche-2 MVP — one build, two unlocks (hackathon submission + second grant tranche).
- **⚠️ Pitfall — verify the wallet's chain before advising swaps/allocations:** In this session the same USDG balance was initially misread as Robinhood Chain (wrong) and then correctly identified as Solana (right, from the MetaMask Solana wallet + the fact Paxos mints USDG on Solana). Never assume a stablecoin's chain from the token symbol alone — read the wallet context (which app/account it's in, which network the wallet UI shows) and confirm the chain supports the token natively before recommending a swap, bridge, or allocation path.

**July 20, 2026 — Superteam Agentic Engineering Grant APPROVED (200 USDG) + Solana Superstars ($10k) pending:**

- **Grant:** Agentic Engineering Grants by Superteam + SendAI
- **Amount:** 200 USDG (fixed, not up-to)
- **Project:** GenTech — x402 Agent Toolkit & Compliance Platform
- **Status:** ✅ Approved — KYC pending to unlock first 50% tranche (100 USDG)
- **Payment schedule:** 50% upfront (post-KYC), 50% on ship (URL + GitHub repo + coding sub receipt)
- **Payment token:** USDG (Paxos-issued, Solana SPL token — wallet must be compatible)
- **Processing:** Mondays noon UTC — if KYC clears before then, first tranche hits same week
- **KYC flow:** Submit via the Earn dashboard (purple "Submit KYC" button on the grant page)
- **Wallet used:** `71Y3H36eb2WRGseYM9GwinjNawfMfAUbcof5eeWGoGSA` (Solana, USDG-compatible)
- **Key learning:** The application was submitted via the standard earn.superteam.com flow (not solana.new — that's a different grant program). The approval email came from hello@superteam.fun with clear next steps. No founder video required for this grant tier.

**July 9, 2026 — GOAT + Avalanche Field-by-Field Prep:**

- GOAT Network Tally form (8 pages) mapped field-by-field — see `references/goat-tally-form-patterns.md`
- Avalanche Mini Grant ($10K) requires sign-in at build.avax.network — paste-ready text in vault
- Avalanche Accelerator ($30K) requires Discord pitch (no open application)
- Chainlink Integration Grant ($20K-$50K) identified, deferred until DeFi API has Chainlink feeds
- Monad: no grant program — Monad Madness pitch competition ($1M) is closest
- Master doc saved: `00-HQ/grant-application-master-2026-07-09.md`
- Key learning: Field-by-field Tally form prep saves more time than drafting narrative sections

**July 6, 2026 — Avalanche Grants ($30K + $10K):**

- User shared X post: Avalanche has two grants ($30K, $10K)
- Gentech drafted two applications:
  1. AAE Stack ($30K) — broad impact, agent economy on Avalanche
  2. DeFi Intelligence API ($10K) — direct Avalanche integration, LP tooling
- Retro9000 ($9K) identified but deferred (rewards past work, we don't have enough Avalanche-specific impact yet)
- Key learnings:
  - Different grant sizes → different product angles (broad vs focused)
  - Retroactive grants require DELIVERED work (not proposals)
  - Grant applications need "ship first" narrative — lead with what's already deployed
- Files saved:
  - 00-HQ/avalanche-grant-1-application.md
  - 00-HQ/avalanche-grant-2-application.md
  - 00-HQ/retro9000-avalanche-retro-grant.md
  - 00-HQ/avalanche-grants-application.md (overview + checklist)
- Build queue updated with priority #1: Avalanche grants application
- Total opportunity: $40K (active) + $9K (retro, deferred) = $49K potential
