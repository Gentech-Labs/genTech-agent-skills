# DeFi LP Position Monitor (Lightweight / Cron)

Run a recurring LP position + watchlist report using only off-chain APIs, apply vault skip-logic to avoid noise, and flag for milestone review when thresholds are breached.

## When to Use vs. On-Chain Reader

| Situation | Use This Skill | Use `defi-onchain-position-reader` |
|---|---|---|
| Daily cron, price alerts, summary | Yes — lightweight | Overkill — slow |
| Per-bin breakdown, share-of-pool | No — lacks granularity | Yes — web3.py reads |
| Rebalance decision needs exact reserves | No — approximate only | Yes — accurate |
| Mobile/low-bandwidth context | Yes — few API calls | No — heavy RPC |

## Data Sources

### 1. CoinGecko (free, no key — preferred)
```bash
curl -sS -o /tmp/cg_prices.json "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=avalanche-2,joe,usd-coin&vs_currencies=usd&include_24hr_change=true"
```
- Use for watchlist prices and 24h changes.
- Batch all token IDs in a single call.
- Note: CoinGecko IDs are not ticker symbols (e.g., `avalanche-2`, not `AVAX`).
- **Caveat**: Aggressive rate limiting (HTTP 429). Do not rely on it as the sole source in a cron job.
- **Tirith workaround**: In environments with `curl | python` security-block rules, always save to `/tmp/*.json` and read afterward with `read_file` or parse in `execute_code`. Never pipe curl directly to an interpreter.

### 2. Binance Public API (free, no key — fallback)
```bash
curl -s "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr?symbol=AVAXUSDT"
```
- Use when CoinGecko 429s or is unreachable. No API key required.
- Returns `lastPrice` and `priceChangePercent`.
- Supports major pairs. If a token has no direct USDT pair, use a BUSD or BTC bridge pair.

### 3. CoinMarketCap (requires key — secondary fallback)
```bash
curl -sS -o /tmp/cmc_prices.json "https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?symbol=AVAX,JOE,USDC" \
  -H "X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY: ${CMC_API_KEY}"
```
- Save JSON to `/tmp/cmc_prices.json` then parse (avoids `curl | python` security blocks).
- Use when both CoinGecko and Binance fail or when a CMC key is available.
- **Key discovery**: Extract `CMC_API_KEY` from `${VAULT_DIR}/00-System/secrets.env` if not already in the shell environment. Do not assume env vars survive across cron sessions.
- More reliable than CoinGecko for high-frequency cron jobs.

### 4. DexScreener (free, no key — pool data)
```bash
curl -sS -o /tmp/dex_pool.json "https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/pairs/avalanche/{POOL_ADDRESS}"
```
- Use for pool volume, TVL, priceNative, priceChange, active bin proxy (priceUsd).
- Save with `-o` then read via `read_file` or parse in `execute_code`.
- **Caveat**: Can return HTTP 403 after repeated calls from the same IP. Treat it as best-effort.
- Verify pool address has contract code before trusting data. If DexScreener returns empty, the address may be stale.

## Workflow (One Cron Run)

1. **Fetch watchlist prices** (Cascading fallbacks)
   - Try CoinGecko first. If 429 or failure, fallback to **Binance Public API**.
   - If Binance also fails and a CMC key exists, fallback to **CoinMarketCap**.
   - **Key discovery**: Extract `CMC_API_KEY` from `${VAULT_DIR}/00-System/secrets.env` if not already in the shell environment. Do not assume env vars survive across cron sessions.
   - Flag 1.5%+ 24h moves. Skip smaller changes in the report.

2. **Fetch pool data** (DexScreener)
   - Record: `priceUsd`, `priceChange.h24`, `volume.h24`, `liquidity.usd`.
   - Verify pool address matches config. If DexScreener returns `pairs: null`, the address may be wrong — log the error to the vault and abort.

3. **Estimate wallet-level fees** (approximate)
   ```python
   total_fees_24h = volume_24h * fee_rate  # e.g., 0.0005 for 5 bps
   share = position_usd / pool_tvl
   est_wallet_fees = total_fees_24h * share
   ```
   - This is intentionally approximate. Flag in the report: `Est Fees: ~${value}`.

4. **Apply skip-logic before vault update**
   - Compare current price vs. last vault entry price.
   - If `|delta| < 0.5%` AND `IL < 0.5%` AND price within declared target range → **skip vault append**.
   - Never skip if: IL ≥ 1.0% (review), price exited range (review), milestone threshold hit, or fees exceeded compound threshold.

5. **DeFi / Milestone Alignment**
   - Load milestone config JSON (e.g., `.lfj-aae-config.json` in scripts path).
   - Check:
     - Current tier active?
     - Daily fees vs. tier target?
     - IL ≥ 2%? Flag for review.
     - Price outside strategic band for >12h? Flag for review.
     - Efficiency ≥ 50%? If yes, no micro-DCA needed.
   - Record: `Tier: X`, `Status: ✅ Stable / ⚠️ Review Needed`, `Next Tier: Y`.

6. **Write vault entry (only if not skipped)**
   - File: `${VAULT_DIR}/03-Projects/DeFi/LFJ-AVAX-USDC.md`
   - Append using ISO 8601 datestamp header (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Template below.

7. **Telegram summary**
   - Deliver to configured group.
   - Always include: watchlist prices, pool status (✅ Stable / ⚠️ Review Needed), flagged alerts, vault link.

## Vault Entry Template

```markdown
## 2026-04-30 Update
**AVAX Price**: $[X.XX]
**Price Range**: $[min]–$[max] (Target: $[target_min]–$[target_max])
**Balances**: [X.XX] AVAX (~$[USD]) + [XX.XX] USDC (~$[USD]) = **$[Total]**
**Wallet**: [X.XXXX] AVAX (~$[USD]) | **Combined Total**: **$[Total]**
**Fees (24h)**: $[fees_24h]  *est. from pool volume*
**IL**: [±X]% (vs. HODL)
**Rewarded Bin**: ✅ Active bin [ID] within position range ([N] bins total)
**Efficiency**: [X]%.
**Action**: No rebalance needed / Rebalance suggested: [reason]

**DeFi Milestone Alignment**:
- Position value ($[value]) aligns with **[Tier]** tier.
- Price is inside the strategic target band ($[X]–$[Y]) and the config range ($[A]–$[B]).
- IL is well below the 2% review threshold.
- Micro-DCA trigger: Efficiency ≥50% → no bonus DCA required.

**Other Pools**: [List any additional LFJ pools, or "No additional pools detected."]
```

## DeFi Milestone Tracker File

Create a separate tracker file at:
`${VAULT_DIR}/03-Projects/DeFi/DeFi-Milestone-Tracker.md`

Include:
- Tier table (Tier, Label, Daily Target, Status)
- Strategic goals (range, IL threshold, compound threshold, DCA efficiency trigger)
- Rebalance history log

This keeps the main LP vault file focused on per-run telemetry, while the tracker holds strategic context.

## Skip-Logic Rules

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Price delta < 0.5% + IL < 0.5% + in-range | Skip vault append |
| IL ≥ 1.0% | Append vault, flag review |
| Price exits range | Append vault, flag review |
| Milestone tier achieved | Append vault, celebrate |
| Compound threshold met ($50+) | Append vault, flag compound |
| DCA day + efficiency < 50% | Append vault, flag boost DCA |
| Any API call fails | Append vault with error block, notify |

## Error Handling

When an API fails mid-run:
1. Log the failure into the vault entry under an `**Errors**` block.
2. Include the HTTP status or exception message.
3. Flag `Action: Review needed — data incomplete`.
4. Always deliver the Telegram summary mentioning the partial data / error.

## Multi-Pool Monitoring

If additional pools exist (e.g., AVAX/JOE, USDC/JOE):
1. Repeat step 2 for each pool address.
2. Summarize in the "Other Pools" section of the vault entry.
3. If no other pools have active positions for the wallet, explicitly state: `No additional LFJ pools detected with active positions for this wallet.`

## Cron Frequency

Recommended: **4× daily** to catch intraday volatility without being noisy.
- 08:15 UTC — morning check
- 12:15 UTC — midday check
- 16:15 UTC — afternoon check
- 20:15 UTC — evening check

Use the system cron or Hermes cron jobs. On each run, always execute skip-logic independently; do not chain state between runs.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/root/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-aae-config.json` | Pool address, DeFi milestones, DCA config, alert rules |
| `${VAULT_DIR}/03-Projects/DeFi/LFJ-AVAX-USDC.md` | Live telemetry vault |
| `${VAULT_DIR}/03-Projects/DeFi/DeFi-Milestone-Tracker.md` | Strategic goals + rebalance history |

## Pitfalls

- **Wrong pool address in runbook:** Always verify the DexScreener response before writing vault data. If `pairs` is null, the address is stale or a typo — use the config address instead.
- **CoinGecko rate limits:** If you get 429, wait 60s or switch to CoinMarketCap if an API key is available.
- **Cron auto-delivery collision:** When a cron job is configured to auto-deliver its final response to a Telegram target (e.g., `-1002916759037`), **do not** call `send_message` to that same target. The system will skip it as a duplicate and waste a turn. Instead, write the summary directly into the final response and let the cron pipeline deliver it automatically.
- **Fee estimation is not on-chain:** It assumes uniform fee distribution. Flag it as estimated, not exact.
- **Fee formatting in vault:** When `(pool_vol * fee_rate * share)` produces a tiny fraction, format as `~$0.03`; round to 4 decimals if < $1, and always include the share % in parentheses so the math is transparent.
- **Missing JSON state files:** The runtime JSON tracker files (`.lfj-aae-state.json`, `.lfj-position-tracker.json`, etc.) may not exist on the filesystem. If they are absent, fall back to reading the last vault entry to extract last-known price, balances, and skip-logic comparison. Do not crash the job if a JSON file is missing — log a warning, proceed with vault-based history, and include the gap in the error block.
- **Skipping too aggressively:** Never skip on errors or threshold breaches. Skip-logic is for stable, in-range, low-IL days only.
