# DeFi Training Data Schema

Used by the GenTech DeFi model training pipeline. Every LP observation gets logged with labeled features for future model training.

## What Gets Logged

- Every Jordan DCA or rebalance (from LFJ screenshots)
- Every cron monitor report (from defi-lp-consolidated.py)
- Every narrative rotation scan (sentiment + zone)

## Training Use Cases

1. **Shape prediction** — given price action + volatility, which shape earns most?
2. **Range optimization** — given market regime, what range width maximizes fees?
3. **Rebalance timing** — given efficiency trend, when should you rebalance?
4. **Mode routing** — given sentiment + rainbow zone, which mode (harvest/accumulate/dry powder)?

## Connection to Routing Layer

The routing layer spec (`Strategies/smart-routing-layer-spec.md`) defines how mode decisions are made. This training data captures the inputs and outcomes so the model can learn which decisions worked.
