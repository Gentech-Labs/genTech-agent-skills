# LFJ/AAE Orchestration (Full)

> Absorbed from `defi-lfj-monitoring` skill. Script matrix, config locations, and SOP.

## Script Matrix

| Script | Purpose | Output | Frequency |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| `defi-milestone-summary.py` | Daily executive snapshot | Markdown | Once daily |
| `defi-master-cron.py` | Consolidated watchlist + LP + DCA | Markdown + signals | 4× daily |
| `lp-aae-signal-monitor.py` | AAE signal generation | JSON + human | On-demand |
| `lp-unified-monitor.py` | Silent range + milestone monitor | SILENT or JSON | Every 5min |
| `lfj_monitor.py` | Price + wallet tracker | JSON | 4× daily |
| `lp-position-reader.py` | On-chain bin decoding | JSON | On-demand |
| `defi-lp-consolidated.py` | **Primary monitor** — alert-once | SILENT or Markdown | Every 10min |

## Config & State Files

**Config (milestone ladder, DCA rules):**
- Primary: `~/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-aae-config.json`
- Vault backup: `${VAULT_DIR}/03-Strategies/scripts/.lfj-aae-config.json`

**Position Tracker (primary source of truth for monitor):**
- `~/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-position-tracker.json` (main)
- `~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/scripts/.lfj-position-tracker.json` (cron context)

**⚠️ Config can drift from tracker.** Config is updated by rebalance handler; tracker may lag. Config wins for range/shape/balances.

**State (persistent across runs):**
- `~/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-position-state.json` — last price, alert flags, days in range
- `~/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-milestone-tracker.json` — cumulative fees, milestones hit
- `~/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-efficiency-trend.json` — efficiency history

## Standard Operating Procedure

### 1. Quick Health Check (<30s)
```bash
cd ${VAULT_DIR}/03-Strategies/scripts
python3 defi-milestone-summary.py
```

### 2. Full Signal Analysis (<60s)
```bash
python3 lp-aae-signal-monitor.py
```
Extract: `current_tier_label`, `fee_efficiency`, `suggested_action`, `severity`

### 3. Consistency Verification
```bash
diff ~/.hermes/scripts/.lfj-aae-config.json      ${VAULT_DIR}/03-Strategies/scripts/.lfj-aae-config.json
```

### 4. Deep Dive (if needed)
```bash
python3 lp-position-reader.py   # On-chain bin-level
python3 lfj_monitor.py          # DexScreener + wallet balances
```

## Critical Cross-Script Inconsistencies

1. **Milestone Ladder Divergence** — Different scripts use different tier thresholds ($3 vs $5 for Scout). Pick one and align.
2. **Fee Estimation Method** — Some hardcode fees, some estimate from volume, some use on-chain oracle. Standardize on TVL-weighted.
3. **Efficiency Calculation** — Different formulas across scripts. Agree on one.
4. **State File Location Fragmentation** — Multiple profiles write to different paths. Symlink or standardize.

## Cron Data Freshness Protocol

Cron jobs must run `lp-position-reader.py` FIRST, update config, THEN compose report. Without this, cron reports stale balance figures.

## Notification Policy (Jordan's Preference)

**Alert once per condition change. Stay silent otherwise.** Empty stdout = no Telegram delivery.

**Implementation:** Track `last_alerted_condition` in state. Fire alert only on:
1. New condition detected (5-min debounce)
2. Condition changes severity
3. Condition resolves then degrades
4. 1-hour cooldown elapsed

## Vault Entry Atomic Write Protocol

Use `scripts/atomic-vault-append.py` for destructive-safe append that:
1. Reads entire vault
2. Splits by `## YYYY-MM-DD Update` headers
3. Merges new entry with existing same-date block
4. Atomic `mv` to prevent partial writes

## LFJ-Specific RPC Call Sequence

1. Call `activeId()` → current active bin
2. Scan ±50 bins with `balanceOf(wallet, binId)`
3. For each bin with shares, `totalSupply(binId)` → share_pct
4. Price range from bin offsets using geometric formula

**Key selectors (hex, no 0x prefix):**
```
activeId:     0xdbe65edc
balanceOf:    0x00fdd58e
totalSupply:  0xbd85b039
```

## On-Chain Verification (Added Jun 22, 2026)

The primary monitor (`defi-lp-consolidated.py`) now verifies on-chain data before reporting:

1. **Reads defi-data.json** (on-chain reader output)
2. **Compares range/shape/amounts** against config files
3. **Auto-corrects** if drift >2¢ or shape mismatch
4. **Flags imbalanced positions** (>90% one token)
5. **Shows data age banner** if defi-data.json is >2h old

```
⚠️ RANGE MISMATCH: On-chain [6.1776–6.4039] vs Config [6.0400–6.1960]
  ✅ Auto-corrected: 6.0400–6.1960 → 6.1776–6.4039
```

**force_send flag:** Set `force_send: true` in `.lfj-defi-state.json` to override debounce and force a report.

## LP Shape Detector (GenTech Original)

Script: `${PROFILE_DIR}/scripts/lp-shape-detector.py`

Detects strategy shapes from on-chain bin distribution:
- **Curve:** Bell-curve, peak at center (range-bound markets)
- **Bid-Ask:** Liquidity at edges (volatile markets)
- **Spot:** Single bin (precision plays)
- **Asymmetric:** Skewed (directional bets)

Reads from `curveData.bins` in defi-data.json. Outputs shape classification with confidence %.

## Preflight Auto-Fix

The preflight script (`/root/.hermes/scripts/preflight.py`) now auto-fixes safe issues:
- **Vault sync:** Auto-commits uncommitted changes + pushes
- **Git state:** Auto-aborts stuck rebases, auto-switches detached HEAD to main
- **Position sync:** Auto-corrects config drift from position tracker

Pattern: Detect → Fix → Verify → Report

## Delegation & Routing

| Issue Type | Owner |
|------------|-------|
| Milestone ladder, efficiency formula | YoYo |
| State file persistence, profile paths | DMOB |
| Cron scheduling, alert routing | Gentech |
| Vault entry updates | Gentech |

## Gas Reserve & Retry Discipline (added 2026-10-03)

### Reserve is per complete deploy, not per transaction
A curve deploy is TWO single-sided legs; when the router allowance has moved it is THREE transactions (approve + two legs). Size `floor_usd` / the native-gas reserve to the whole atomic operation. A reserve sized for one cycle leaves the wallet unable to pay for the second leg's approve, the simulation reverts, and the loop may retry forever with the book empty and capital idle.

### The top-up target must cover the whole deploy, not the floor
A wrapper that calls `gas_topup.py` with no `--target` restores only the **floor** (one cycle). That funds the first leg of a multi-tx deploy but can leave the wallet short for the second leg and the approve. The result is a half-built book and idle capital — exactly the failure the top-up was meant to prevent. Pass `--target N` where N is the **cycle count of the complete operation** (e.g. 3 for a curve with an allowance refresh) so the wallet holds the floor plus the full deploy before any leg is spent.

### Refill from the wallet's WAVAX when the book is empty
With no open position there is no book WAVAX for `[4a] PROVISION GAS` to draw on. The cheapest leg is WAVAX → native AVAX (~36k gas). Only swap USDC → AVAX when no WAVAX is available.

### Stop and escalate after identical failures
A deterministic gas/allowance/config deadlock does not self-heal by repetition. After two consecutive failures with the same root signature, surface the captured cause and require operator input. Retrying forever on a gas deadlock may drain the reserve and leave a half-built book.
