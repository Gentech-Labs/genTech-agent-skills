# Lychee Studio → Unreal Engine 5.8 Pipeline

## Overview
3D character pipeline for upgrading Vanito's Seedance 2.0 characters (KAGE, HIKARI) to full 3D models with Chaos Clothing physics in Unreal Engine 5.8. Forge handles the actual 3D work — this doc is the reference handoff.

## Pipeline Steps

|------|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | **Lychee Studio** | Generate 3D characters, clothing, props from text/images. Props Extraction breaks a character into separate game-ready pieces. | 20€/seat/mo (20K credits) |
| 2 | **Blender** | Fit, align, adjust AI-generated meshes. Sculpt mode for quick shape fixes. | Free |
| 3 | **AccuRig** | Auto-rig character, export to Unreal skeleton. | Free |
| 4 | **Unreal Engine 5.8** | Import, retarget animations, Chaos Clothing physics, build the game. | Free (5% royalty) |

## Character Design Specs

### KAGE (current — Look 3)
- Plain black t-shirt, no jacket
- Rectangular pendant
- Full blackwork sleeve tattoos both arms
- Stratocaster with "KAGE" text
- Wet messy hair, bloody hands
- Grungier/rawer aesthetic
- Role: Screamer (anguish, raw power)

### HIKARI
- Long black hair with vibrant RED HIGHLIGHTS/STREAKS throughout (not just tips)
- Black lace choker with pendant

## Target: VISUAL KEi TAP Remake

The existing rhythm game (`games/visual-kei-tap/index.html`) is a 3-lane canvas game with 6 KAGEKŌ tracks. The remake in Unreal would feature:
- 3D KAGE and HIKARI models with Chaos Clothing physics
- 3D stage with lighting, particle effects
- 3D falling notes instead of canvas rectangles
- Character idle/hit/miss/combo animations
- Capes, coats, accessories that move with physics
