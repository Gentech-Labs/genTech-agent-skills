# Harness Self-Evolution Cycle

The Harness Evolution agent makes a Hermes instance measurably more useful to its USER — not to its own bookkeeping. The Critic is its adversary. This skill governs running that cycle correctly.

## The GATE (read first, every cycle)

> **Metric authoring**: before writing a recommendation's `## Measurable improvement expected` block, read `references/metric-authoring-pitfalls.md` — parser-safe metric form, the self-advancing-metric trap, and the stale-sentinel pitfall.

1. Read `${HERMES_HOME}/harness/constitution.md`. It is **proposal-only** by default — never `git commit` to it; write amendments to `facts/amendment-proposal.md` and notify the user.
2. Read `facts/critique-log.md`. **If the last 3 entries are unaddressed, THIS cycle's job is to address them — a NEW hypothesis is disallowed.** Execute the most recent counter-recommendation verbatim.
3. Fix, don't just report. If a problem is fixable with available tools (patch, file write, cron edit), fix it this cycle. Only defer to the operator when the fix needs their credentials or a decision.

## External proposals when the gate is closed (human greenlights a NEW hypothesis)

The gate above governs the Evolution cron's own cycles. A DIFFERENT situation: Jordan (or another session) approves a brand-new improvement idea while the last critique is still open / a counter-recommendation is already bound to the next cycle. Do NOT write it to `facts/recommendation.md` — that file is owned by the cycle queue, and injecting a fresh hypothesis overwrites or collides with the bound counter-recommendation (the exact anti-pattern the gates exist to stop). Instead:

1. **Stage it in the vault build queue** (`10-Labs/build-queue.md`) as a numbered item with the source, the idea, and an explicit `Do NOT inject into facts/recommendation.md now — evolve-N (timestamp) is bound to the open critique; a new hypothesis is gate-blocked until it clears.`
2. Optionally add a one-line pointer in `11-Mess Hall/considerations.md` if it also needs a go/no-go decision.
3. Report honestly to the user: the idea is captured and will be lifted as the sanctioned hypothesis on a future cycle once the pending critique is ADDRESSED — do not claim it is queued for the immediate next run.

Worked example (Aug 2, 2026): Jordan approved "metacognitive self-modification" for the harness (from facebookresearch/HyperAgents research). The evolve-36 counter-recommendation was already bound at 16:00 UTC for an open WATCH/high critique, so the idea went to build-queue #35 as a staged candidate instead of into `recommendation.md`. A future Evolution cycle lifts it when the gate allows a new hypothesis.

## Cycle steps
1. Write the chosen capability + one measurable improvement to `facts/recommendation.md` BEFORE reading state (STEP 0).
2. Ground in evidence: cite ONE `witness-log.md` entry by timestamp. The improvement must be observable to the USER, not a token-economy optimisation (Article II).
3. Append a falsifiable prediction to `predictions.md` before executing (STEP 2.5).
4. Execute: `cd ${HERMES_HOME}/harness && bash scripts/execution-loop.sh evolve 2>&1 | tail -15` (note: the script lives in `scripts/`, not the harness root).
5. Report ACTION or NO-OP. Never deliver an empty response; if genuinely nothing, reply `[SILENT]` (alone).

## recommendation.md must be machine-parseable
Full field-by-field parser contract, the exact metric selector, and copy-paste
pre-flight/post-flight checks: `references/plan-file-contract.md`.
`execution-loop.sh` parses fields with `^FIELD:` at line start (case-insensitive). Markdown headers like `## RECOMMENDED_ACTION:` are NOT matched (the parser exits on `^#`). Write the dispatch fields as plain lines:
```
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: update_script
CONFIDENCE: high
DETAIL: <one line describing the edit>
REASONING: <why>
```
Keep prose context under `##` headers, but the four dispatch fields must be bare.

### A missing `DETAIL:` writes a content-free audit row (evolve-32/33)
`_parse_field "DETAIL"` returning empty **was unguarded until evolve-34** (it now aborts
dispatch with `PLAN MISSING DETAIL`; keep the self-checks below anyway) — `execute_action` checked
only `action_type`, then built `full_detail="${action_detail} || ${metric_out}"`.
A plan with no `DETAIL:` line therefore ships
`- detail:  || METRIC: …` into `execution-log.md` and `- Change: || …` into
`harness-state.md`: a row asserting a completed cycle while recording **nothing about
what it did**. That is the phantom-report class the harness exists to prevent, landed
inside its own audit trail. It also degenerates the `(cycle, action, detail)`
idempotency fingerprint, which is computed over `$a_detail`.

- Before dispatching, always self-check: `grep -c '^DETAIL:' facts/recommendation.md` == 1.
- After dispatching, always self-check: `grep -c 'detail:  ||' facts/execution-log.md` == 0.
- Backfilling a content-free row is a legitimate `facts-cleanup` action. Restore the
  content from the plan file at that cycle's commit and leave an inline
  `<!-- backfilled at evolve-N … -->` comment saying it was backfilled and why (Article V:
  a repaired trace must announce the repair).

### The metric block must be BACKTICKED — `METRIC:` prefixes are silently ignored
`_verify_recommendation_metrics` selects lines with
`grep -E '`(grep|awk|wc)[^`]*`'` inside the `## Measurable improvement expected`
section, and **`[[ ${#lines[@]} -gt 0 ]] || return 0`** — no match means it returns
success having verified nothing. So a plan whose metrics read
`METRIC: grep -c 'x' file -> 0` produces **zero** captured metrics and a green row.
Correct format is a backticked expression plus a trailing comparison:
```
## Measurable improvement expected
- `grep -c 'detail:  ||' facts/execution-log.md` == 0
- `grep -cE '^[[:space:]]*CYCLE_ID=' scripts/execution-loop.sh` >= 1
```
Verify the block parses BEFORE running the loop:
`sed -n '/^## Measurable improvement expected/,/^## /p' facts/recommendation.md | grep -cE '`(grep|awk|wc)[^`]*`'`
should equal the number of metrics you declared. This is a third instance of the
fail-open family (`:282` returns 0 on no-match, like the old empty-cycle-id and
non-numeric-output holes) — see `references/plan-file-contract.md`.

### evolve-34: the gate now FAILS CLOSED — and the whitelist silently drops non-grep metrics
`:282` was replaced (evolve-34) with a fail-closed branch: an empty metric set now prints
`METRIC: NONE DECLARED — plan block matched no `grep|awk|wc` expression [FAIL]` and returns 1,
so "no metrics ran" downgrades the row to `partial(metrics-failed)` instead of reading `ok`.
A `PLAN MISSING DETAIL` guard was added after the `action_type` parse for the same reason.
Both are proven by `scripts/selftest-detail-metric-gate.sh` (4 asserted cases, rc=0).

**Residual hole — declare metrics ONLY as `grep`/`awk`/`wc`.** The selector whitelist is
literally `(grep|awk|wc)`; a metric written as `` `bash scripts/selftest-foo.sh` == 0 `` matches
nothing and is *silently skipped* (the `continue` on an empty `expr`), so a 4-metric plan lands
3 `[PASS]` tokens with no complaint. Dropping a metric is a smaller sibling of the fail-open
family. Until the whitelist is widened, express script-based checks in whitelisted form, e.g.
`` `bash scripts/x.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; echo $?` `` will NOT parse — instead assert on an artifact
the script produces, or run the script yourself and report the divergence in the cycle report.

### evolve-36: COVERAGE is now enforced IN THE LOOP — and how to count it correctly
Because skipped metrics are silent, "every metric in the row passed" is NOT the same claim as
"every declared metric ran". As of evolve-36 `_verify_recommendation_metrics` enforces parity
itself: it counts `^- ` lines in the `## Measurable improvement expected` block as *declared*,
increments an `executed` counter **inside the emit loop**, and on `executed < declared` prints
`METRIC: COVERAGE SHORTFALL <n>/<m> [FAIL]` + `rc=1`, downgrading the row to
`partial(metrics-failed)`. Proven by `scripts/selftest-detail-metric-gate.sh` (6 asserted cases:
`assert_e` = 3 declared / 1 parseable → shortfall fires rc=1; `assert_f` = 2/2 → rc=0).

**Two counting rules that are load-bearing — both were violated by the cycles that shipped them:**

1. **Count executed metrics AT THE EMITTER, never by re-grepping the log.** The log will contain
   this very row's detail prose, which quotes the metric strings, inflating the count. evolve-35's
   parity falsifier used `grep -o 'METRIC:' | wc -l` and read **5** against 4 real results because
   the detail contains the `; METRIC:` chain. If you must count from the log post-hoc, use a
   prose-immune pattern matching only emitted result lines:
   `awk '/^## evolve-N/,0' facts/execution-log.md | grep -oE 'METRIC: [^|;]+ -> ' | wc -l`
2. **Any declared metric whose pattern can appear in its own row's detail must be `>= 1`, or
   `awk`-scoped to the target row.** A metric declared `== 1` that the gate evaluates *before*
   `_append_execution_log` runs will PASS at gate time and FAIL for the user re-running it one
   second later, because the append created a second occurrence. This is the self-referential-count
   class biting at row level rather than prediction level.

**MANDATORY: re-run every declared metric AFTER dispatch and report the results in the cycle
report.** A metric that passes only before its own row exists is not a metric. This is the single
most-repeated Critic finding across evolve-33..36 — the work was real every time; the instruments
measuring it were not re-run.

**Meta-lesson: a Critic counter-recommendation can be wrong in its specifics.** The
evolve-32 critique instructed "prefix each metric with `METRIC:`"; followed literally
that produces zero parsed metrics. Execute the counter-recommendation's *intent*,
verify the mechanism against the actual parser, and report the divergence in your
cycle report rather than silently complying or silently deviating.

### evolve-37: a counter that matches BOTH a definition and its call site double-counts
`grep -c '^assert_' scripts/selftest-detail-metric-gate.sh` published **12** for a selftest
that runs **6** assertions — the pattern matched 6 function definitions (`assert_a() {`) AND
6 invocations (`assert_a`). The file's own runner printed `ALL 6 ASSERTIONS HOLD` on the same
line of output. Worse, two thresholds had already been *calibrated to the broken counter*
(evolve-34 shipped `>= 4` against 8, evolve-36 `>= 10` against 12), so the lie propagated into
the pass criteria of later cycles.

**Rule: count the RUNTIME ARTIFACT, never the source text.** A test's emitted output has exactly
one line per executed assertion; its source has two mentions per assertion.
`bash scripts/selftest-X.sh 2>&1 | grep -cE '^PASS: '` cannot double-count.
FORBIDDEN in any metric or falsifier: a pattern that can match both a function definition and an
invocation of that same function. Before publishing any count, sanity-check it against a second
independent statement of the same quantity (here, the runner's own summary line) — if two numbers
for one quantity differ by a factor of two, the counter is wrong, not the code.

### evolve-37: the metric block needs a terminator and no blank lines (two rival counters)
Two different counters for "how many metrics did the plan declare" are live in the tree and they
are NOT the same expression:
- the gate, `execution-loop.sh:294`: `sed -n '/^## Measurable improvement expected/,/^## /p' | grep -cE '^- '` — terminates on the next `## ` header
- the predictions' parity falsifiers: `awk '/Measurable improvement expected/,/^$/' | grep -c '^-'` — terminates on the first BLANK LINE

They agree only when the metric block contains no blank line AND is followed by a `## ` header —
neither property was enforced. A blank-line-separated block makes awk undercount, so the same row
grades PASS by the gate and FALSIFIED by the prediction. An EOF-terminated block makes the sed
range never close, so every trailing `- ` bullet in the file inflates `declared`.

Therefore, when writing `facts/recommendation.md`:
- ALWAYS follow the metric block with a `## ` header (add a throwaway `## Block terminator` if the block would otherwise end the file).
- NEVER put a blank line between `- ` metric bullets.
- Pre-flight both counters and confirm they agree before dispatching:
  `sed -n '/^## Measurable improvement expected/,/^## /p' facts/recommendation.md | grep -cE '^- '`
  and `awk '/Measurable improvement expected/,/^$/' facts/recommendation.md | grep -c '^-'`.
These clauses are now written into the `== Metric block contract ==` section of `prompts/evolution.md`.

### evolve-38: the two rival counters are now ONE — `_count_declared_metrics()`
The sed/awk split above is CLOSED. `scripts/execution-loop.sh` now defines a single
`_count_declared_metrics()` (awk, block starts at `## Measurable improvement expected`,
terminated on the next `^## ` **and** by an explicit EOF guard — the `END { print n+0 }`
rule fires unconditionally), and the gate calls it. Predictions grading declared-vs-executed
coverage MUST call/quote that same expression rather than inventing a second one.
`scripts/selftest-detail-metric-gate.sh` assertion **(g)** proves fn-path and awk-path agree
(=2) on a block containing a blank line between bullets. Keep writing blocks with no blank
lines and a trailing `## ` header anyway — that is the contract the counter is asserted against.
Regression guard: any future cycle that reintroduces an independent declared-metric counter
instead of calling `_count_declared_metrics` is a falsifier hit (PREDICTION #37 f7).

### The plan file must contain the dispatch tokens EXACTLY ONCE — including inside prose
`execution-loop.sh` refuses to dispatch with
`✗ recommendation.md carries 2 RECOMMENDED_ACTION headers — refusing to dispatch a possibly
stale plan`. This fires on **any** occurrence of the token, including one buried in your own
`DETAIL:` narrative (seen live at evolve-38: the DETAIL described rewriting a state file's
`RECOMMENDED_ACTION: facts-cleanup` field and tripped the guard). When a plan's prose needs to
refer to a dispatch field, write it as *action type* `` `facts-cleanup` `` — never as the bare
`FIELD:` token. Pre-flight: `grep -c 'RECOMMENDED_ACTION' facts/recommendation.md` == 1
(count the token, not just `^RECOMMENDED_ACTION:`).

### evolve-39: post-dispatch re-verification is now IN THE LOOP (`_reverify_published_metrics`)
The "re-run every declared metric AFTER dispatch" rule below is no longer manual.
`scripts/execution-loop.sh` defines `_reverify_published_metrics <cycle> [log]`, wired as the
**last statement of the evolve arm** — after `refresh-next-events.sh` and
`refresh-harness-state.sh`. It parses `METRIC: <expr> -> <value> [<tag>]` triples out of the
current cycle's `- detail:` row, re-runs each expr from `$HARNESS_DIR`, and compares.

**Design rule that makes it usable — judge the CRITERION, not the value.** The naive version
(fail on any value change) fired a false positive on its very first live run: the measured file
was `facts/execution-log.md` itself, which grew because the row containing the measured phrase
was appended to it. So:
- live value differs but the published `[PASS >= N]` criterion **still holds** → emit
  `<!-- METRIC SHIFT … criterion >= N still holds -->`, `log_warn`, **rc unchanged**.
- criterion **broken**, or no comparison was declared → emit `<!-- METRIC DRIFT … -->`,
  `log_error`, **rc=1** (the cycle fails; the receipt is unreproducible).
Reuse `_metric_compare` for the arithmetic — do not write a second comparator (same
one-counter rule as `_count_declared_metrics`).
Asserted by `scripts/selftest-detail-metric-gate.sh` case **(h)**: published 2, criterion `>= 2`,
post-dispatch value 0 → rc!=0 + drift comment. Runner now prints `ALL 8 ASSERTIONS HOLD`.
Full implementation, parser traps, and the SHIFT-vs-DRIFT rationale:
`references/post-dispatch-reverification.md`.

**Corollary for authoring metrics:** any metric whose pattern can appear in its own audit row
MUST be declared `>= N`, never `== N`. With `==`, the row's own text moves the count and the
new gate correctly fails the cycle.

### evolve-51: the in-loop re-verifier CANNOT see writes made after the loop exits
`_reverify_published_metrics` is the last statement of the evolve arm, so it only observes
writes made **inside that process**. When you (the agent) edit `facts/predictions.md` or any
measured file *after* `bash scripts/execution-loop.sh evolve` returns — which is the normal
shape of a hand-executed cycle — the gate is structurally blind. That is how evolve-42
published `grep -c '!= 6' facts/predictions.md -> 0 [PASS == 0]` against a live value of **2**
with no `METRIC DRIFT` annotation. The function was never broken: re-running it by hand on the
same row emitted DRIFT and returned 1.

**Diagnose before you "fix".** The obvious remedy (move the call later in the arm) changes
nothing — it was already last. Source the function and run it against the suspect row first:
```bash
source <(awk '/^_metric_compare\(\)/,/^}/' scripts/execution-loop.sh)
source <(awk '/^_reverify_published_metrics\(\)/,/^}/' scripts/execution-loop.sh)
_reverify_published_metrics evolve-N /tmp/copy-of-log.md; echo "rc=$?"
```
If it fires by hand but not in the run, the bug is REACHABILITY, not logic.
Packaged as `scripts/reverify-row-probe.sh` in this skill — run
`bash scripts/reverify-row-probe.sh evolve-N [harness_dir]`; it works on a COPY of the ledger
so it can never annotate the real one.

**Fix shape: re-verify at the CYCLE BOUNDARY, where every write from the prior cycle has
landed regardless of which process made it.** `_reverify_prior_cycle` runs at the start of the
evolve arm against the last `^## evolve-N` row, annotating but never aborting (the prior cycle
is already shipped; aborting deadlocks the harness). Plus a standalone
`bash scripts/execution-loop.sh reverify [evolve-N]` arm for manual checks. Make the drift
annotation **idempotent** (skip if a `METRIC DRIFT <cycle>` line already names that expr),
otherwise the boundary check accretes one duplicate comment per cycle forever.

**Generalised rule: a self-check that only runs inside one process cannot police artefacts
that other processes write. Put the check at the boundary the artefact must cross.**

### evolve-51: the self-matching-criterion ban now lives in the PARSER, not in prose
Four consecutive recurrences (#34 f3, #36 f3/f4, #37 f4) of "criterion greps the file it is
written into, so writing it changes its own value" proved prose rules do not hold. The gate now
emits `SELF-MATCHING CRITERION` + `rc=1` for an unscoped `grep` whose target is
`facts/predictions.md`. `awk '/range/,/range/' … | grep …` forms are artefact-scoped and pass.

> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED (evolve-52) — the "scope such a clause narrowly" advice below was WRONG

Also: when rewording an Article V amendment note, the note itself
must not contain the literal it describes — that note was one of the two live matches that
made the evolve-42 receipt false. Corollary for **voiding** an already-published self-matching
metric: append an Article V `VOID self-matching` note to the offending row explaining that the
metric counted the act of reporting rather than the fix, restate the claim artefact-scoped, and
**do not write the counted literal anywhere in the correction** — otherwise the correction
inflates the very number it retracts.

### evolve-51: `.cycle-highwater` advances on ATTEMPT, so aborted pre-flights burn cycle ids

> ✅ **FIXED (evolve-52), then RE-FIXED (evolve-53) — the evolve-52 placement was itself

Historical behaviour (pre-evolve-52): the high-water mark was written at derivation, before
any gate ran. Three aborted
pre-dispatch attempts in one session (`PLAN MISSING DETAIL` → `NONE DECLARED` →
`STALE PLAN HEADER`) each consumed an id, so a cycle authored as `evolve-43` dispatched as
`evolve-51` with 43–50 empty. Nothing is lost, but the Critic will read an 8-cycle gap.

- **Pre-flight the plan file COMPLETELY before the first invocation** (see
  `references/plan-file-contract.md`): `^DETAIL:` == 1, `^RECOMMENDED_ACTION:` == 1 token,
  `Cycle evolve-N` present, and the metric block parses — verify the last one by sourcing
  `_verify_recommendation_metrics` and running it directly rather than by launching the arm.
- **The metric block heading is load-bearing**: metrics under a `## Verify` heading are
  invisible. They must sit under `## Measurable improvement expected`, as backticked
  `grep|awk|wc` expressions with a trailing comparison, followed by a `## ` terminator.
- Each retry needs `rm -f facts/.dispatch-sentinels/dispatched-evolve-N` (and the stale
  `facts/.dispatch.lock`) — expected while aborting before `✓ action dispatched`.
- If ids get burned, renumber the plan/prediction to the **derived** id and leave a dated
  Article V `<!-- id note -->` in both `execution-log.md` and `predictions.md` naming the empty
  range and its cause. Do not silently let the gap stand.

### The `byte-identically` rule vs the `grep|awk|wc` whitelist — how to resolve the conflict
`prompts/evolution.md` now FORBIDS narrowing/re-patterning a Critic's literal verify expression.
But the metric parser only accepts backticked expressions starting with `grep|awk|wc`, and Critics
routinely bind `` `bash scripts/selftest-X.sh 2>&1 | grep -cE '^PASS: '` `` — which the parser
silently skips, firing a false COVERAGE SHORTFALL. Resolution (used at evolve-39, permitted by the
rule itself): publish an `awk`-prefixed wrapper that runs the identical command and counts the
identical lines, and carry a dated **Article V note** in the plan naming the original expression,
its live value, and the reason:
```awk
awk 'BEGIN{while(("bash scripts/selftest-X.sh 2>&1"|getline l)>0) if(l ~ /^PASS: /) n++; print n+0}'
```
Never substitute silently — the note is what separates this from the evolve-38 DEGRADATION finding.

### Never declare a metric on a field the post-dispatch refresh scripts rewrite
`refresh-harness-state.sh` and `refresh-next-events.sh` run **after** `✓ action dispatched`
and overwrite `facts/harness-state.md`'s header, `## Last Action` block and Next Events. A
metric like `` `grep -c 'Cycle evolve-37' facts/harness-state.md` >= 2 `` therefore PASSES at
gate time and re-reads **0** one second later — the file correctly advanced to evolve-38.
That is not a regression, but it makes the published row unreproducible, which is exactly the
instrument dishonesty the harness exists to catch. Assert instead on fields the refresh
scripts do NOT touch (the `## Critique Status` list, ledger files, script/prompt contents).
If you already shipped such a metric, **report the divergence in the cycle report** with the
reason — do not let the next Critic discover it.

**Sub-case (evolve-59): never metric your OWN cycle's future receipt.** Writing
`` `grep -c 'evolve-59' facts/harness-state.md` >= 1 `` or
`` `grep -c '^## evolve-59' facts/execution-log.md` == 1 `` into the evolve-59 plan is
unmeasurable at gate time (the row/header don't exist yet — the metric FAILS `== 1` against 0,
and a `>= 1` against 0 is also a fail), and it is exactly the self-referential count the
parser's SELF-MATCHING CRITERION branch exists to reject. Declare metrics that hold BEFORE
dispatch (selftest PASS count, counter present in a script, assertion name present). If you
want to assert the receipt exists, that is the `_reverify_published_metrics` / `_reverify_prior_cycle`
gate's job, not a plan metric's. The plan's `## Block terminator` header is required so the
block never runs to EOF.

### A row removal is INCOMPLETE until every derived ledger is reconciled (partial rollback)
Deleting a phantom row from `facts/execution-log.md` is only the visible third of the job. The
same dispatch also wrote:
- `facts/.dispatch-state` — action-type **count AND timestamp** (this is the cumulative counter
  the monoculture argument is reasoned against; a phantom leaves it permanently +1)
- `facts/harness-state.md` — header, `## Last Action`, `## Critique Status`
Leaving the phantom as *last writer* of either file is a **partial rollback** — true in its most
visible part, false as a whole, i.e. the phantom-PR witness class reproduced inside the
anti-phantom fix (this is what evolve-37 did and evolve-38 repaired). Reconcile all three in the
same cycle, note the correction + its cause in `facts/cleanup-log.md`, and check
`stat` mtimes: if a ledger's mtime equals the phantom's dispatch time, it has not been repaired.
This rule is now a REQUIRED clause in `prompts/evolution.md` (`partial rollback`).

### Critic verify commands can be over-broad — scope them before adopting
The evolve-37 counter-recommendation specified
`grep -c 'ADDRESSED (evolve-36)' facts/harness-state.md` == 0 to prove the self-attribution was
gone — but that pattern also matches *legitimate* older lines (`evolve-35 critique: ADDRESSED
(evolve-36)`), so the metric could never pass. Narrow it to the offending line's full text
(`'evolve-36 critique: ADDRESSED (evolve-36)'` == 0). Same meta-lesson as elsewhere in this
skill: execute the counter-recommendation's intent, verify its literal commands against live
state first, and report the divergence.

### Attribution rule: a cycle cannot address the critique it caused
`- evolve-N critique: ADDRESSED (evolve-N)` is always wrong — the critique is issued *after*
that cycle dispatched. The addressing cycle is N+1 (or later). Check timestamps
(`Critique Entry — <ts>` vs the audited cycle's dispatch time) before writing the line.

### NEVER re-run `execution-loop.sh evolve` to debug — it appends a PHANTOM ROW
**UPDATE (evolve-40): this is now ENFORCED IN CODE, not just by discipline.**
`_acquire_dispatch_lock` is the first statement of the evolve arm: an exclusive
non-blocking `flock -n 200` on `facts/.dispatch.lock` plus a per-cycle sentinel
`facts/.dispatch-sentinels/dispatched-<CYCLE_ID>` (moved out of `facts/.tmp` at evolve-41 —
see below) with a 3h cron floor. A second invocation inside the
window exits 3 with `DISPATCH ALREADY RUNNING` and writes nothing. Skipped when
`REPORT_ONLY=true`, and deliberately NOT acquired at source time — the selftest sources
the loop and would self-deadlock.

**UPDATE (evolve-41) — a lock is only as durable as the state it lives in.** The evolve-40
lock closed the *concurrent-process* case and left two *state-destruction* cases open, both
of which reproduce the same phantom row:
- `facts/.dispatch.lock` was a **tracked** git object, so any `git checkout` / `reset --hard`
  / `stash` in the harness repo swaps the inode under a live holder; a second arm then opens
  the NEW inode and takes `flock` cleanly. Fix: `git rm --cached` it, `.gitignore` it, and
  after `exec 200>"$lock"` assert `stat -c %i "$lock"` equals `stat -Lc %i /proc/self/fd/200`,
  failing closed with `DISPATCH ALREADY RUNNING — lock inode swapped`.
- The sentinel lived in `facts/.tmp/` — gitignored scratch shared with critic artifacts and the
  natural target of any cleanup arm. One `rm -rf facts/.tmp/*` evaporates the cron floor with
  zero log line. Fix: relocate to `facts/.dispatch-sentinels/` (explicitly gitignored) and
  forbid cleanup arms from touching it.

**Generalised rule (now REQUIRED in `prompts/evolution.md`): a guard whose state lives in a
directory another arm may delete is not a guard. Guard state must be in a path no cleanup arm
can reach — and must not be a tracked git object, since git operations rewrite inodes.**
Proof lives in `scripts/selftest-dispatch-lock.sh` (case (j) reproduces the inode-swap hole in
an isolated tmpdir and asserts the shipped branch closes it; case (k) asserts sentinel locality).

**Selftest authoring trap seen writing that file:** a static assertion that greps the
implementation for a forbidden string will match **its own explanatory comment** in that
implementation. `awk '/^_fn\\(\\)/,/^}/' file | grep -q 'facts/\\.tmp'` fired FAIL against the
comment saying "guard state must NOT live in facts/.tmp". Always strip comments before a
forbidden-string grep: `… | sed 's/#.*//' | grep -q …`, and scope the range to the function
rather than the whole file (the string is legitimate elsewhere).

**Second selftest authoring trap (evolve-59): a fixture whose metric expressions do not
REPRODUCE makes the case fail on drift.** When a selftest case exercises
`_reverify_published_metrics` (cases h/q/r), every `METRIC: <expr> -> <val>` it writes into the
fixture ledger row is **re-evaluated live** against `$HARNESS_DIR` by the re-verifier. A fake
expression like `` grep -c 'X' file `` with no backing file re-runs as `file: command not found`,
the re-verifier records `METRIC DRIFT` + returns non-zero, and the case fails even though the
*point* of the case (e.g. "prose must not inflate the count") is unrelated to the metrics'
values. Fix: give the fixture a **real data file** and write metric expressions that genuinely
reproduce against it:
```bash
local dataf="$TMP/q-data.md"; printf 'X\nY\nY\n' > "$dataf"
# fixture row metric:  `grep -c 'X' "$dataf"` -> 1 [PASS == 1]   # actually re-runs clean
```
Two corollaries: (a) place prose meant to be ignored AFTER the real metric lines — the
pair-parser spans from `METRIC: ` to the next `[...]`, so leading/interspersed prose gets
absorbed into a bogus pair; (b) a bare prose literal `METRIC:` (no ` -> `) is what the
prose-immune counter ignores — that is the fixture's point, but only when it sits outside the
parser's `METRIC: … […]` span. The case passes only when the metric values reproduce, the
prose-immune count matches `_count_declared_metrics`, and PLAN MUTATED does/doesn't fire as
asserted.

**Verification after hand-executing a bound counter-recommendation: use `--report-only`.**
When you have already applied the fix with `patch`/`write_file` and committed, running
`bash scripts/execution-loop.sh evolve` fires a real dispatch for work already done — the exact
double-dispatch the lock exists to prevent. Run `bash scripts/execution-loop.sh --report-only
evolve` instead: it exercises the full arm (arm discovery, external-feedback gate, credential
pre-flight, field parse) and stops before execution. Say in the report that `--report-only` was
deliberate, so the next Critic does not read it as a skipped step.

Three operational consequences you WILL hit:
- **Legitimate iteration requires clearing the sentinel:** `rm -f facts/.dispatch-sentinels/dispatched-evolve-N`
  before each retry. Do this only while the run is still *aborting before* `✓ action dispatched`.
  Once a real dispatch lands, stop — that is the terminal state.
- **A NEW scenario: resolved-cycle sentinels block a legitimate LATER dispatch.** The 3h cron-floor
  guard (`find "$sentinel_dir" … -newermt "-3 hours"`) fires on ANY recent sentinel, including ones
  from cycles that already shipped their receipt. Seen live at evolve-59: sentinels `evolve-51..57`
  all had `^## evolve-N` rows (resolved), but `dispatched-evolve-57` (mtime 18:21) sat inside the
  3h floor and blocked the 20:14 dispatch with `DISPATCH ALREADY RUNNING … refusing re-entry`.
  **Verify each blocking sentinel belongs to a RESOLVED cycle before clearing, and never clear the
  fresh sentinel the current dispatch creates:**
  ```bash
  for s in facts/.dispatch-sentinels/dispatched-evolve-*; do
    id="${s#*dispatched-}"
    grep -q "^## ${id} " facts/execution-log.md && rm -f "$s"   # resolved -> safe to clear
  done
  ```
  A sentinel with NO matching ledger row means that cycle never dispatched and its floor is doing
  its job — leave it. Clearing resolved sentinels is a legit `facts-cleanup`-adjacent step; note it
  in the cycle report so the next Critic does not read it as bypassing the lock.
- **Debug re-runs still bump `facts/.dispatch-state`'s cumulative counter** even though the lock
  blocked them and no rows were written. Reconcile it by hand at the end of the cycle
  (baseline + 1 real dispatch) and leave a dated `<!-- ledger note … -->` in `execution-log.md`
  saying why the number moved. The row count is authoritative; the counter is not.
- **Removing a phantom row RENUMBERS the next cycle.** Cycle id is `max ^## evolve-N + 1`, so
  deleting the phantom `evolve-40` makes your live cycle `evolve-40`, not `evolve-41`. The plan
  header, `harness-state.md` and `predictions.md` must all be renumbered to the *derived* id or
  `_assert_cycle_trace` fires `STALE PLAN HEADER` — which presents as a **silent** early return
  (dispatch logs look normal, no row appears). Reclaiming a phantom's number is correct; add a
  `> Numbering note:` block to the plan saying the id was reclaimed and why.

**UPDATE (evolve-42) — the INVERSE phantom: real work, NO receipt. Guarding the door does
not guard the ledger.** Five cycles hardened re-entry so a second dispatch could not write a
row. evolve-41 proved the opposite hole was wide open: it shipped a real commit and wrote **no**
`## evolve-41` row, so `max ^## evolve-N + 1` stayed frozen at 41 and the *next* dispatch would
have re-issued `evolve-41` over already-shipped work — the same id collision, arrived at from the
other direction. Two root causes, both now fixed:

- **CYCLE_ID was derived solely from the ledger it is supposed to write.** A dispatch that runs
  without appending cannot advance its own counter. Fix: keep an independent high-water mark
  (`facts/.cycle-highwater`, gitignored) written at derivation time and derive from
  `max(execution-log max id, high-water)`, emitting `LEDGER GAP: …` to stderr when the two
  disagree. Asserted by `scripts/selftest-dispatch-lock.sh` case **(l)**.
- **A no-execution path was writing the ledger that certifies execution.** The `REPORT_ONLY`
  branch called `_record_dispatch` and then `return 0` *before* any action ran, so
  `facts/.dispatch-state` counted dispatches that never dispatched. Fix: a separate
  `_record_report_only` → `facts/.report-state`. `.dispatch-state` now means "arms that actually
  executed" and nothing else.

**Generalised rule: a counter must not be readable only from the artifact its own writer may
skip, and a path that performs no work must not increment the counter that certifies work.**
Two ledgers, one advanced unconditionally at issue time, one appended only on real completion —
disagreement between them is the signal, not an error to suppress.

### ⚠️ evolve-54: THE ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE of the recurring missing receipt — `set -e` aborts before the append
Everything above this line treats "real work, no receipt" as a **counter-placement** problem, and
five cycles (evolve-42, 51, 52, 53) moved the high-water write around trying to fix it. That was
the wrong layer. The receipt was missing because `execute_action` **died before reaching
`_append_execution_log` at all**:

```bash
set -euo pipefail                                    # line 13 of execution-loop.sh
...
metric_out="$(_verify_recommendation_metrics)"; local metric_rc=$?   # ← ABORTS HERE
```

`_verify_recommendation_metrics` returns **non-zero BY DESIGN** whenever a declared metric fails
(that is the whole point of the fail-closed gate). Under `set -e`, a **plain assignment** whose
command substitution exits non-zero terminates the function immediately. The very next lines —
the `partial(metrics-failed)` downgrade and the ledger append — were unreachable. So **every cycle
with a failing metric shipped committed code and wrote no row**, and the `; local metric_rc=$?`
idiom made it look like the author had handled the failure.

Fix — capture the status with `||`, which `set -e` explicitly tolerates:
```bash
local metric_out status_override="" metric_rc=0
metric_out="$(_verify_recommendation_metrics)" || metric_rc=$?
```

**Diagnostic signature — memorise this.** The pre-fix run's last log line is
`✓ action dispatched` and then *nothing*, with no error and exit code 0. The post-fix run on the
same tree logs `⚠ declared metrics did not all pass — result downgraded to partial` and appends
the row. If a run's output stops cleanly at a known-good log line, **the next statement is a
`set -e` abort, not a silent early `return`** — look for an assignment, `let`, or arithmetic
expansion that can legitimately evaluate non-zero.

**Bash rules that follow (they generalise far past this harness):**
- `x="$(cmd)"; rc=$?` is a **lie under `set -e`** — `$?` is never read when `cmd` fails, because
  the shell already exited. Only `x="$(cmd)" || rc=$?` preserves the status.
- `local x="$(cmd)"` is the inverse trap: `local` *masks* the exit status, so the abort never
  happens and `$?` reads the status of `local` (always 0). Declare `local` and assign on
  **separate lines** whenever the status matters.
- `((n++))` evaluates to 0 when `n` was 0 → aborts under `set -e`. Use `((n++)) || true` or `n=$((n+1))`.
- **Never let a function that returns non-zero by design sit on the critical path to an audit
  write.** Order the code so the ledger append happens first, or guard every such call.

**Meta-lesson (the reason this took five cycles): four consecutive fixes patched the mechanism
named in the previous critique instead of reproducing the failure. Reproduce first.** Run the
thing, watch where the output stops, and fix *that* line. Full reproduction recipe and the
wider `set -e` trap catalogue: `references/set-e-abort-before-audit.md`.

### ⚠️ evolve-55: FREEZE THE PLAN AT DISPATCH — a criterion you can edit after grading is not a receipt
evolve-54 rewrote `facts/recommendation.md` **2m27s AFTER** the dispatch that graded it (plan
mtime 04:12:35 vs execution-log / .dispatch-state / .cycle-highwater all 04:10:08). The published
receipt therefore said `METRIC: NONE DECLARED [FAIL]` about a plan block that no longer existed,
while the plan that DID exist failed the live gate with a self-matching criterion + coverage
shortfall — neither disclosed. **Every gate hardening in this skill is unenforceable while the
grading sheet is mutable after grading.**

Fix (shipped evolve-55): in `_append_execution_log`, immediately before the high-water write,
snapshot the plan verbatim — and keep the directory OUT of `.gitignore`, because the snapshot IS
the receipt's evidence:
```bash
local _snap_dir="${HARNESS_DIR}/facts/.plan-snapshots"
mkdir -p "$_snap_dir" 2>/dev/null
[[ -f "$RECOMMENDATION_FILE" ]] && cp "$RECOMMENDATION_FILE" "${_snap_dir}/${cycle}.md" 2>/dev/null || true
```
`_reverify_prior_cycle` then grades the prior cycle against `facts/.plan-snapshots/<cycle>.md`,
logging `PLAN SNAPSHOT MISSING` (warn, never fatal) when absent. The first run after shipping
this WILL warn for the previous cycle — that is correct, not a failure.

**Generalised rule: any artefact that grades work must be frozen at the moment of grading. If a
later process can rewrite the criterion, the receipt proves nothing — and the audit will look
healthy the whole time.** Sibling of the two-ledger rule; same family as "measure the artefact,
not the receipt".

**Authoring trap found the same cycle — prose backticks are parsed as metrics.** The metric
selector is `grep -E '`(grep|awk|wc)[^`]*`'` applied to the WHOLE
`## Measurable improvement expected` range, so an Article V note in that range reading
"restated in whitelisted `awk` form" is picked up as a metric expression `awk`, executes
non-numeric, and FAILS the gate. **Never backtick the bare words grep/awk/wc in prose inside or
after the metric block** — write them unquoted (`whitelisted awk form`). Symptom: a `[non-numeric
FAIL]` line naming a one-word expression.

**Pre-flighting the gate: capture its output, don't let it print.** Calling
`_verify_recommendation_metrics` directly after sourcing can come back looking completely
silent with rc=0 through the `terminal` tool (output lost/swallowed), which reads as "no metrics
declared". Always capture and echo instead, so you see the real result:
```bash
bash -c 'set +e; . ./scripts/execution-loop.sh; echo "declared=$(_count_declared_metrics)"; \
  out=$(_verify_recommendation_metrics); echo "rc=$?"; echo "$out"'
```
`declared=N` plus N `METRIC: … [PASS …]` lines and `rc=0` is the green pre-flight.

### Verify a bound counter-recommendation is still open BEFORE executing it
A counter-recommendation can already be fully addressed by the time your cycle runs — another
session, or the cycle that received the critique, may have executed it. At evolve-54 all four
items (A)-(D) of the open high-severity critique were **already ADDRESSED** on the live tree.
Re-executing them would have produced a duplicate-work receipt and hidden the real defect.
Run each item's own `Verify:` command first and record the result in the plan's evidence
section. If all pass, say so explicitly, then spend the cycle on the residual the verification
exposes — that is where evolve-54 found the `set -e` abort.

### `refresh-harness-state.sh` silently no-ops unless the plan says the literal `Cycle evolve-N`
It selects with `grep -oE 'Cycle evolve-[0-9]+' facts/recommendation.md`. A correctly-named plan
titled `# Recommendation — evolve-55` matches **nothing**, and the script exits 0 with
`no cycle in recommendation.md — no-op` — which reads like success in a `| tail` and leaves the
state header a full cycle stale. (That staleness is what the evolve-52 critique logged as
measurement 8 and item (D).) evolve-54 added a fallback to any `evolve-N` in the file. Regardless,
always **read back `head -1 facts/harness-state.md`** after calling it; never trust its exit code.

**Operational corollary — WRITE YOUR OWN RECEIPT when you hand-execute a bound
counter-recommendation.** This is how evolve-41 lost its row and how evolve-42 nearly repeated it.
When you apply the fix yourself with `patch`/`write_file` + `git commit`, the loop run afterwards
is `--report-only` (correctly — see above), which appends nothing. **You must append the
`## evolve-N` row to `facts/execution-log.md` by hand** with a re-run metric chain, and refresh
`facts/harness-state.md`'s header + `## Last Action`. Final check before ending any hand-executed
cycle: `grep -c '^## evolve-<your id>' facts/execution-log.md` == 1 and `head -1
facts/harness-state.md` names your cycle. A cycle that shipped code and left no receipt is
indistinguishable, to the user and to the next Critic, from a cycle that did nothing.

**Backfilling someone else's missing row:** re-run every metric **live against the working tree**
before writing them — never copy the numbers out of the originating session's report — and carry
an inline `<!-- BACKFILLED by evolve-N at <ts>. <cause>. Metrics re-run live. Article V. -->`
comment. A backfilled receipt whose numbers were transcribed rather than re-measured is itself a
phantom.

Historical context for why the lock exists: cycle id is derived from the row count in
`execution-log.md`, so a **second successful dispatch inside the same wall-clock cycle
auto-advanced to `evolve-N+1`** and wrote a duplicate audit row for work done once. This
happened at evolve-37, evolve-38 and evolve-40. Four cycles treated the phantom rows as a
cleanup problem and none asked why re-entry was possible. **Meta-lesson: when the same defect
class recurs 3+ times despite being documented and rule-bound, stop repairing the symptom and
ask what makes it POSSIBLE.** A rule against untidy rollbacks does not close an unlocked door.

At evolve-37, a debug re-run 26 seconds after the real
dispatch produced a byte-identical `## evolve-38` row, which (a) published a duplicate row and
(b) falsely consumed the evolve-38 slot that the standing critique had bound to a specific
sanctioned action. Its own self-referential metric even read `2` instead of `1` because it counted
its predecessor's string.

- **Validate the plan file BEFORE the first run**, not by iterating on the loop. Full pre-flight
  checklist in `references/plan-file-contract.md`. Minimum: `grep -c '^RECOMMENDED_ACTION:'` == 1,
  `grep -c '^DETAIL:'` == 1, `grep -c 'Cycle evolve-N'` >= 1, both declared-counters agree.
- The plan header MUST contain the literal token `Cycle evolve-N` (`_assert_cycle_trace` greps
  `"Cycle ${_cyc}"`). A header reading `# Recommendation — evolve-37 …` FAILS with
  `STALE PLAN HEADER`; it must read `# Recommendation — Cycle evolve-37 …`.
- If a phantom row does land, **remove it** rather than annotate — a duplicate row for
  work done once is itself the phantom-report class. Back the file up first, delete the block,
  and append a dated `<!-- phantom-row removal … -->` comment explaining the removal, the backup
  path, and why removal beat annotation (Article V: the repair announces itself).
- Note the failing runs that abort BEFORE `✓ action dispatched` (missing DETAIL, stale header)
  append nothing — those are safe to iterate on. Only a *successful* dispatch advances the id.
- **Corollary seen live at evolve-39:** once your cycle has dispatched successfully, any further
  `bash scripts/execution-loop.sh evolve` aborts with `STALE PLAN HEADER: plan does not name
  evolve-N+1`. That abort is the guard **protecting you** — it is the expected terminal state of a
  completed cycle, not a failure to fix. Verify your work by sourcing the loop and calling the
  function directly (`source scripts/execution-loop.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; _reverify_published_metrics
  evolve-N`) instead of re-running the arm.
- **The unaddressed-critique abort will block your FIRST run of a cycle whose whole job is to
  execute that critique.** Do the work, then flip the blocking entry's `- Action: PENDING` to
  `- Action: ADDRESSED (evolve-N) — <summary>`, then run. Expected, not a bug (see the section on
  clearing it legitimately).

Allowed action types: update_script, create_skill, analyze, integrate_config, smoke_test, facts-cleanup, cleanup_and_integration_test, backup_scheduler, test_mechanism, version_bump, version_registry, skill_version_registry, bash_command, generic_action, skill_automation. Diversify — a monoculture of one action type (e.g. 7x `update_script`) is a stagnation signal the Critic flags.

### When a dispatch logs `✓ action dispatched` but writes NO row
A silent early return (usually `STALE PLAN HEADER`) — the arm's own output looks healthy.
`bash -x` trace technique, the sentinel-clearing retry loop, the `-x`-pollutes-metrics trap,
and a symptom→cause checklist: `references/diagnosing-silent-dispatch-failures.md`.

**Check the `set -e` abort FIRST (evolve-54).** If the output stops *immediately* after
`✓ action dispatched` with no further log line and no error, it is not a `return` — it is
`set -e` killing the function on `metric_out="$(_verify_recommendation_metrics)"`, which
exits non-zero by design whenever a declared metric fails. This was the real cause of the
missing-receipt class for five cycles. Recipe + bash trap catalogue:
`references/set-e-abort-before-audit.md`.

## Anti-Pattern: self-reported result:ok without running the declared metric
The recurring, highest-severity failure. A cycle declares a success metric in `recommendation.md` (e.g. `` `grep -c 'x' file` == 0 ``) but writes `- result: ok` to `execution-log.md` without ever running it — the audit trail lies. Caught across THREE consecutive harness cycles (Jul 31, 2026): the Change line was 190 chars against its own declared ≤180, and the fix-shipping cycle re-injected the exact string it was purging.

**Fix — gate the result field on the declared metrics IN THE LOOP, not per-cycle.** A per-cycle patch cannot fix a per-cycle blindness. Add a verifier that parses the backticked `grep/awk/wc` expressions out of the plan file, runs them, echoes one `METRIC:` line each into the audit detail, and downgrades `ok` → `partial(metrics-failed)` if any metric fails:
```bash
_verify_recommendation_metrics() {
    local rc=0 expr out
    mapfile -t exprs < <(sed -n '/^## Measurable improvement expected/,/^## /p' "$RECOMMENDATION_FILE" \
        | grep -oP '(?<=`)(grep|awk|wc)[^`]*(?=`)')
    [[ ${#exprs[@]} -gt 0 ]] || return 0
    for expr in "${exprs[@]}"; do
        out="$(cd "$HARNESS_DIR" && eval "$expr" 2>&1 | head -1)" || true
        printf 'METRIC: %s -> %s\n' "$expr" "$out"
        case "$out" in ''|*[!0-9]*) rc=1 ;; esac
    done
    return $rc
}
```
Call it immediately before `_append_execution_log` and append the `METRIC:` lines to the detail so the log carries inline proof the metrics ran. **Key insight:** a cycle that can rewrite its own pass criterion between the plan file and the prediction file cannot be falsified by the Verifier — the gate must live in the loop, and the audit entry must carry the metric OUTPUT, not a bare `ok`.

### Threshold-aware gate (evolve-26 fix — the snippet above is INCOMPLETE)
The `case "$out" in ''|*[!0-9]*) rc=1` test above only checks the output is a *number* — it accepts `0`. A metric declared `>= 1` that returns `0` is still graded `ok`. That is a second-order version of the same self-verification lie. The gate must parse each metric's **trailing comparison** (`>= <= == > <`) + operand and evaluate `out <op> operand`, failing when the comparison is FALSE — not only when the output is non-numeric:
```bash
_metric_compare() { # $1=out $2=op $3=operand -> 0 if holds
    case "$2" in
        '>=') [[ "$1" -ge "$3" ]] ;; '<=') [[ "$1" -le "$3" ]] ;;
        '==') [[ "$1" -eq "$3" ]] ;; '>')  [[ "$1" -gt "$3" ]] ;;
        '<')  [[ "$1" -lt "$3" ]] ;; *) return 0 ;;  # no op -> presence-only
    esac
}
```
Iterate over whole metric LINES (not just the backticked expr), pull `expr` with `grep -oP '(?<=`)(grep|awk|wc)[^`]*(?=`)'`, then: non-numeric → FAIL; `op` set and `_metric_compare` false → FAIL; else PASS.

> ⚠️ **CORRECTED (evolve-40) — do NOT scrape `op`/`operand` from the whole line.**
> The long-standing `grep -oE '(>=|<=|==|>|<)[[:space:]]*[0-9]+'` applied to `$line`

> ```

### evolve-40: unfalsifiable thresholds are rejected by the gate
`>= 0` on a counter (always ≥ 0) and any negative operand are non-measurements. The gate
now prints `METRIC: … [UNFALSIFIABLE CRITERION >= 0 — no counter value can fail this; FAIL]`
and `rc=1`. Asserted by selftest case **(i)**; runner prints `ALL 9 ASSERTIONS HOLD`.
**Authoring rule (now REQUIRED in `prompts/evolution.md`): every published threshold must be
one the PRE-CHANGE live value actually FAILS.** Record the pre-change value next to each
metric in the plan. A threshold your starting state already satisfies proves nothing.
Companion clause: a METRIC must never measure `facts/execution-log.md`,
`facts/harness-state.md` or `facts/.dispatch-state` for a phrase that appears in the
dispatching row's own DETAIL — *measure the artefact, not the receipt*. Emit `METRIC: <expr> -> <out> [PASS >= 1]` / `[FAIL >= 1]` so the audit entry proves the threshold was checked, not just the run.

**Prove it with a re-runnable selftest**, don't eyeball it. Ship `scripts/selftest-metric-gate.sh` that sources the loop and asserts: a metric failing its threshold → rc=1, one satisfying it → rc=0. Reference it as a metric in `recommendation.md` so the gate verifies itself. See `references/metric-gate-selftest.md` for the working script + the two sourcing traps below. For proving a *guard* (not a metric) can fail — the tautology detector, the `^CYCLE_ID=` anchor gotcha, and the `set +e`-after-source trap — see `references/guard-falsifiability.md`.

## When the operator asks about a critique delivery (Aug 1, 2026)

The Harness Critic cron delivers its audit to the user's channel (e.g. Telegram
HQ). When Jordan replies "is there anything for me to do?", the answer comes
from the critique's own **"Operator Action Required"** line, not from re-reading
the whole audit:

- **`Operator Action Required: none — Evolution must address <items> in <next
  cycle>`** → NO operator action. The counter-recommendation is queued for the
  next Evolution cycle automatically; the loop self-handles. Say so plainly and
  summarize what the next cycle will do (e.g. "evolve-30 at 16:00 UTC fixes both
  items, then the next Critic verifies"). Do not invent homework for the user.
- **`Operator Action Required: <something>`** → that something IS the action
  (wallet decision, credential, approval). Surface it as a clear ask.

Also explain the verdict honestly: WATCH/high means the loop found NEW weaknesses
on top of a genuine fix — the harness catching itself inflating its own score is
the system working, not failing. When a critique contradicts a state file's
attribution (e.g. state says `ADDRESSED (evolve-27)` but the critique says
`ADDRESSED (evolve-29)`), trust the critique + `git log` over the state header.

## New high-severity audit findings (evolve-29, Aug 1, 2026)

Two NEW anti-patterns the Critic caught that extend the existing gates:

1. **Guard reading the file it polices (AUDIT GAP cycle-id from plan file).**
   `execution-loop.sh` derived the cycle id via
   `grep -oE 'Cycle evolve-[0-9]+' "$RECOMMENDATION_FILE"` — the same stale-prone
   plan file the assertion exists to police. A stale plan header makes the
   assertion grep for the OLD id, find the OLD row, and pass. **Fix:** cycle id
   must come from the loop's own CYCLE_ID or `highest evolve-N in
   execution-log.md + 1`, and additionally assert the plan header names that
   cycle (`STALE PLAN HEADER` error otherwise). Any guard whose input is derived
   from the bug it detects is trivially satisfiable — sever it.

   **evolve-31 follow-up — the "fix" made it WORSE. Read this before touching a
   guard.** evolve-30 replaced the plan-file read with `_cyc="${CYCLE_ID:-}"`
   plus a log-derived fallback — but never DEFINED `CYCLE_ID` anywhere
   (`grep -rn 'CYCLE_ID' scripts/` = 1 hit, zero assignments). So the fallback
   always ran, reading the log row that `_append_execution_log` had written
   seven lines earlier *from the plan file*. The id was still laundered out of
   the plan; STALE PLAN HEADER became unfirable AND the previously-working
   AUDIT GAP check was killed as collateral — while the declared grep metric
   reported success. **Two rules fall out:**
   - A guard's input must be defined UPSTREAM of, and independently from, the
     artifact it polices. Define the cycle id once at global scope from the log
     clock (`highest ^## evolve-N + 1`), `export` it, and have every consumer
     (including `_append_execution_log`) read that variable.
   - **A textual falsifier cannot verify a semantic claim.** evolve-30's metric
     was `grep -n '_cyc=' … | grep -c RECOMMENDATION_FILE == 0`; it was
     satisfied by moving the read one function away with the dataflow
     unchanged. When the claim is "this guard can fail", the only honest
     falsifier is **executing the guard against a failing input and asserting
     rc=1** — see `references/guard-falsifiability.md`.

   Working shape (evolve-31, verified): extract the assertion into a standalone
   `_assert_cycle_trace()` taking the cycle id as `$1`, call it from
   `execute_action` with `${CYCLE_ID:-}`, and ship
   `scripts/selftest-stale-plan-guard.sh` asserting all three paths — stale
   plan → rc=1 + `STALE PLAN HEADER`; missing log row → rc=1 + `AUDIT GAP`;
   matching → rc=0. Report the residual honestly: AUDIT GAP still checks a row
   the same run wrote, so it verifies "the append happened", not an independent
   signal. Say that in the report rather than letting the next Critic find it.

2. **Grading predictions FULFILLED before their due time (self-scoring
   inflation, Article II).** Verifier stamped `OUTCOME #28/#29 FULFILLED` ~4h
   before the stamped due epoch while the prediction bodies themselves said
   "OPEN / NOT YET DUE". **Fix:** hard rule in `prompts/verifier.md` — an outcome
   may be headed FULFILLED/FALSIFIED only when EVERY falsifier is evaluated AND
   now >= due epoch; otherwise header MUST read `PARTIAL (n/m falsifiers, due
   <ts>)`. Correct existing headers when found. A prediction with an untested
   falsifier is not FULFILLED — this is the harness grading its own homework.

## Verifier: sweep for OVERDUE predictions before trusting the due-window-only read
The Verifier prompt says "read predictions where DUE is between last cycle and now" — but
predictions use **inconsistent due markers** (`DUE:`, `Adjudicate:`, `due <epoch>`, "at the
next Critic cycle", "checkable by Critic evolve-N"), and a prediction can silently pass its
epoch without ever landing in `prediction-outcomes.md` (a prior Verifier run skipped it, or it
used a non-`DUE:` marker). If you only read the due-window, overdue predictions accumulate
unadjudicated forever. Before finalising a cycle:

1. **Cross-check every prediction number.** Enumerate ALL prediction ids in `predictions.md`
   (`grep -oE '^## PREDICTION #[0-9]+' …`) and diff against the ids already handled in
   `prediction-outcomes.md` (`grep -oE 'PREDICTION #[0-9]+' … | sort -u`). Any id in the first
   set but not the second is potentially overdue.
2. **For each missing id, check its due epoch against now** (`date -u`). If `now >= due`, it is
   overdue and MUST be adjudicated this cycle even though it is outside the nominal window. Seen
   live 2026-08-05: #43, #44 and #45 had all passed their due epochs unrecorded and were
   adjudicated alongside #60/#61.
3. **Adjudicate the overdue ones the same way** — run every falsifier live, commit the outcome,
   and note in the report that it was "overdue, adjudicated" so the next Verifier does not
   re-flag it.
4. Also grep `predictions.md` for explicit statuses (`Status: PENDING|OPEN`) and verify each one
   is still genuinely future-due before leaving it.

## Anti-Pattern: computing one field, leaving the adjacent one to rot
Each "computed field" fix historically addressed exactly the one line the previous Critic named (the header, then the Last Action label, then its body), leaving the neighbouring hand-edited line stale — the same defect recurred SIX times. When you make a state field computed, make the whole block computed (header + label + body), not one line.

## Pitfall: falsifiers that measure the wrong thing (mis-specification)
A falsifier can be wrong while the fix it grades is perfectly correct — and then it
records a **false FALSIFIED against working code**, which is worse than no prediction
at all. Two concrete failure modes, both seen live:

1. **Anchored patterns break when code moves.** `grep -c '^CYCLE_ID='` returned 0 after
   a later cycle moved that assignment inside an `if` block and indented it. Behaviour
   unchanged, metric broken. Prefer indentation-tolerant patterns in falsifiers:
   `grep -cE '^[[:space:]]*CYCLE_ID='`.
2. **Self-referential counts.** A falsifier reading
   `` grep -c 'amended 2026-08-02 at evolve-33' facts/predictions.md == 1 `` is false on
   arrival — the falsifier's own text lives in that file, so the count is 2. Use `>= 1`
   for any pattern the prediction file itself contains, and say why inline.
3. **`!=` on a growing quantity is unfalsifiable-in-spirit — it records regression for
   progress.** A falsifier written `` `… | grep -cE '^PASS: '` != 6 `` fires the moment a later
   cycle *adds* a seventh assertion: strictly more proof, graded FALSIFIED. Seen live — #36
   falsifier 4 sat wrong for three cycles while the selftest grew 6 → 9. **Rule: for any counter
   that only ever grows (assertions, guards, tests), the operator must be `<` or `<=`. Reserve
   `!=` for quantities that are genuinely expected to hold a fixed value.** When amending a
   published falsifier this way, change the operator AND leave an inline dated Article V note
   explaining that the old form penalised improvement.
4. **Case-sensitivity on a fixed-string grep is a false FALSIFIED waiting to happen.** A
   falsifier written `grep -c 'superseded' facts/observation-log.md` == 0 fires as a FALSE FAIL
   against a correction entry that correctly spells it `SUPERSEDED` — GNU grep is
   case-sensitive, the lowercase literal matches nothing (rc=1), and a real fix is graded
   FALSIFIED. Seen live at #61 (same class as #59's BRE-vs-ERE literal: `grep -c "METRIC:
   [^|;]+ -> "` where `+` is a BRE literal → returns 0). **For a falsifier asserting *presence*
   of a text marker, use `grep -ci` (case-insensitive) or match the exact casing the fix emits
   — and re-run the literal at authoring time against the state you created.** Distinguish "the
   marker is genuinely absent" from "my pattern couldn't match it": if `grep -ci` finds it but
   exact-case `grep -c` doesn't, the fix is present and the falsifier is mis-specified — record
   the intent as FULFILLED and flag the class in an Article V note, never a false FALSIFIED.

**Rule:** run every falsifier at authoring time, before appending the prediction. If a
falsifier does not return its expected value against the state you just created, the
falsifier is wrong — fix it now, not at the due date. When amending an already-published
falsifier, never silently rewrite it: change the pattern AND append a dated
`(amended YYYY-MM-DD: <why the old pattern could not match>; behaviour unchanged)` note,
per Article V.

## Editing harness scripts under the terminal hardline blocklist
Inline `sed -i`/`awk` with regex + special chars, and `&&`-chained multi-statement lines, get rejected via the `terminal` tool with `BLOCKED (hardline): command parser limit or malformed executable payload` — even in cron/yolo mode. It is NOT a syntax error; the parser refuses the payload. Reliable paths:
1. Use the `patch` tool for in-place edits instead of `sed -i` — this is the go-to for regex-y edits.
2. Run each check as its own standalone simple command (`grep -c 'x' file` on one line, never chained).
   **A quoted argument containing shell metacharacters is enough to trip it even when quoting is
   correct** — `grep -c 'selftest-foo.sh; echo' file` inside an `&&`/`;`-chain of several echoes was
   rejected at evolve-35, while the same grep issued alone ran fine. When a verification batch is
   blocked, don't rewrite the quoting: split it into one call per check and batch them as parallel
   tool calls instead.
3. If you truly need awk/complex logic, `write_file` a tiny `.sh` and `bash /tmp/foo.sh` — a script file passes where the same code inline is blocked.
   **Multi-line `echo "label=$(cmd ...)"` verification batches are reliably BLOCKED** (hit twice
   at evolve-54) — a newline-separated block of `echo` lines each wrapping a command substitution
   trips the parser even with correct quoting. Drop the labels and issue the bare commands
   separated by `;` on ONE line (`grep -c 'a' f; grep -c 'b' f; cat x`), then map the outputs to
   their checks by position. Ugly, but it goes through on the first try.
4. **Appending a block of text: a quoted `cat >> file <<'ZZZ' … ZZZ` heredoc goes through**
   (verified evolve-38 for `predictions.md` and `cleanup-log.md` appends), while a
   `python3 - <<'EOF'` heredoc doing in-place string surgery was refused. So: heredoc for
   pure appends, the `patch` tool for edits-in-place, and never mix the two in one command.

## Pitfall: wc -c vs awk length on UTF-8
`wc -c` counts BYTES (a `—` em-dash = 3 bytes); `awk length` and Python `[:N]` count CHARACTERS. A 170-char payload + 10-char prefix reads 180 via `awk length` but 182 via `wc -c` when it contains multibyte chars. Match the verify tool to the cap's semantics — if the declared metric is `awk length`, verify with `awk length`.

## The pre-execution unaddressed-critique abort — and how to clear it legitimately
`read-external-feedback()` in `scripts/execution-loop.sh` aborts the whole run with
`ABORTED: <VERDICT> <severity> unaddressed` when the LAST `- Verdict:` / `- Severity:`
in `critique-log.md` is high/critical and the last `- Action:` is not literally `ADDRESSED`.
**This fires on `WATCH high`, not just `DEGRADATION critical`** (seen live at evolve-35:
`✗ must_act=true — unaddressed high critique` / `ABORTED: WATCH high unaddressed`). Any
high-severity verdict with a non-`ADDRESSED` action marker blocks dispatch.
It greps `awk '{print $3}'` off the last matching line of each label — so the gate reads
the *most recent* entry only.

Correct sequence when you hit this abort:
1. **Do the fix first.** Never touch the log to unblock yourself before the work is done —
   that is forging the audit trail (Article V).
2. Append a RESOLUTION entry to `critique-log.md` carrying `- Action: ADDRESSED`,
   `- Verdict: RESOLVED`, `- Severity: low`, plus the *verified command output* for each
   item of the counter-recommendation (`git ls-files … | wc -l` == 2, `bash -n` clean, etc.).
3. Re-run the loop. It should reach `✓ action dispatched`.

The abort firing is the gate working. Treat a first-run abort as expected when you are
executing a counter-recommendation, not as a bug.

**Two ways to clear it — pick by whether the critique entry is still open.** Appending a
RESOLUTION entry (above) is right when you want a separate audited resolution record. When
the blocking entry is the counter-recommendation you *just executed in this cycle*, the
cleaner move is to **flip that entry's own `- Action: PENDING` marker in place** to
`- Action: ADDRESSED (evolve-N, <ISO ts> — <one-line summary of what shipped>)`. The gate
reads only the last `^- Action:` line, so both work; in-place editing keeps one entry per
critique instead of growing a second log row per cycle. Locate it with
`grep -n '^- Action:' facts/critique-log.md | tail -3`, and edit via a tiny Python
heredoc that **asserts the target line's current text before replacing it** — a blind
line-number write silently corrupts the ledger if the file shifted:
```python
l = open(p).read().split('\n')
assert l[IDX].strip() == '- Action: PENDING', l[IDX]
l[IDX] = '- Action: ADDRESSED (evolve-35, …)'
```
Still do the fix FIRST. Flipping the marker before the work exists is forging the trail.

**Lighter variant that passes the hardline blocklist (verified evolve-36):** a `sed` *line-address*
replacement is accepted where regex-y `sed -i 's/…/…/'` is refused, provided the replacement text
carries no shell metacharacters. Sequence — three separate simple commands, never chained:
`grep -n '^- Action: PENDING' facts/critique-log.md | tail -3` → pick the line number →
`sed -i '<N>s/.*/- Action: ADDRESSED (evolve-N) — <summary>/' facts/critique-log.md` →
`sed -n '<N-2>,<N+2>p' facts/critique-log.md` to confirm you hit the right entry and its
`Cycle audited:` line still reads the cycle you meant. The read-back is the safety the assertion
provides in the Python variant — do not skip it.

## Pitfall: a Critic counter-recommendation may name an already-used prediction number
The Critic drafts its counter-recommendation from the state it audited, so a "append
PREDICTION #N" instruction can collide with a number the cycle it audited already consumed
(evolve-35: counter-rec said `#33`, but evolve-34 had already published `#33`). Before
appending, check `grep -c 'PREDICTION #N' facts/predictions.md`. If taken, **advance to the
next free number and record the divergence in both the prediction body and the cycle
report** ("counter-rec said #33; already consumed by evolve-34; numbering advanced to #34,
content unchanged"). Do not reuse a number, and do not silently renumber without saying so —
same Article V rule as amending a falsifier. This is another instance of the meta-lesson
above: execute the counter-recommendation's *intent*, verify its specifics against live
state, and report the divergence.

## Pitfall: the actor may be an AGENT, not a script — fix the PROMPT
Before patching code to stop a bad behaviour, confirm a script actually performs it:
`grep -rn '<log phrase it emits>' --include=*.sh .`. If nothing matches, the behaviour came
from a cron *agent* improvising (Gardener, Critic, Evolution). The durable fix then lives in
`prompts/<agent>.md` as a HARD RULE with an explicit pre-action guard and a verification
command the agent must run before reporting success — not in `scripts/`.

### ⚠️ evolve-58: THE FEEDBACK GATE WAS DEAD FOR 17 CYCLES — and how to keep it alive

`read-external-feedback()` in `scripts/execution-loop.sh` is the single mechanism that makes a
Critic finding binding rather than advisory. From evolve-39 to evolve-57 it was **structurally
inert**: it grepped the WHOLE critique-log for `^- Action:` and took `tail -1`, while the Critic
had switched to unprefixed `Verdict:`/`Severity:` headers and stopped emitting `- Action:`.
Result: every high/critical critique was waved through because the gate always found the last
dashed marker — a stale `ADDRESSED (evolve-39)` at line 761 — and returned 0.

**Two fixes, both load-bearing:**

1. **Scope to the LAST `## Critique Entry` block only.** Never grep the whole file for a label
   that may have been superseded. Use awk to isolate the final block:
   ```bash
   _last_entry="$(awk '/^## Critique Entry/{buf=""} {buf=buf $0 ORS} END{printf "%s", buf}' "$critique_log")"
   ```
2. **Tolerate both dashed and unprefixed header styles.** The Critic may emit either. Match
   case-insensitively with `grep -oiE '^(- )?(verdict|Verdict): *[A-Za-z_-]+'` and take `$NF`.
3. **Fail CLOSED on an absent marker.** If `last_action` is empty for a high/critical verdict,
   abort with `ABORTED: <verdict> <severity> — no Action marker in last critique entry`.
   Empty must never read as ADDRESSED — this is the same fail-open family as the empty metric
   set and the whitelist drop.

**Prove it with a selftest, not a grep.** Cases (s) and (t) in `scripts/selftest-detail-metric-gate.sh`
execute the guard against synthetic logs:
- (s) A file with an OLD `- Action: ADDRESSED (evolve-39)` followed by a NEWER unprefixed entry
  with `Verdict: DEGRADATION` / `Severity: high` and NO action marker → gate aborts (rc=2).
- (t) Same file with the newer entry carrying `- Action: ADDRESSED (evolve-58)` → gate passes (rc=0).

**Fix the format at the source.** `skills/harness-critic.md` now mandates the four dashed fields
(`- Cycle:`, `- Verdict:`, `- Severity:`, `- Action: PENDING|ADDRESSED (evolve-N) — items ...`)
immediately under every entry header, with a post-flight that `grep -c '^- Action:'` increases by
1 per entry. The unprefixed style alone (used from evolve-39 to evolve-57) is what left the gate
reading a stale marker for 17 cycles.

**Diagnostic signature — how to tell the gate is dead without running it:**
```bash
grep -c '^- Action:' facts/critique-log.md   # should be >= number of entries
grep -c '^## Critique Entry' facts/critique-log.md  # actual entry count
```
If `^- Action:` count is significantly lower than entry count, the gate is reading a stale
marker. The last `^- Action:` line is the one the gate sees — check it with
`grep -E '^- (action|Action):' facts/critique-log.md | tail -1`.

**Generalised rule: a gate that greps the whole file for a label will always find an ancient one.
Scope every selector to the LAST block of the relevant type, and fail closed when the marker is
absent — not when it is present but old.**

### Pitfall: a placeholder timestamp in an Article V audit note is not evidence
The evolve-56 backfill comment shipped with the literal string `16:0xZ` instead of a real
timestamp — `0x` is not a digit. An Article V repair note whose own timestamp is an unresolved
template is the phantom class reproduced inside the anti-phantom fix. **Never write a placeholder
in an audit note.** If you don't know the exact time yet, leave the field blank and fill it in
before committing — a missing timestamp is honest; a fake one is not. Verify before committing:
`grep -c '0x[0-9a-f]Z' facts/execution-log.md` == 0.

### The inverse-phantom class: real work, no receipt (evolve-41/52/54/56/57)
Five cycles shipped committed code and wrote no `## evolve-N` row. The root cause was `set -e`
aborting before `_append_execution_log` (evolve-54, documented above), but the *pattern* recurred
even after that fix because hand-executed cycles simply never called the append function. When you
apply a bound counter-recommendation with `patch`/`write_file` + `git commit`:

1. **Append the receipt by hand.** Write a `## evolve-N — <ts>` block to `facts/execution-log.md`
   with `- action:`, `- result:`, `- confidence:`, `- detail:` and a `|| METRIC:` chain.
2. **Re-run every metric LIVE against the working tree** — never copy numbers from the
   originating session's report. A backfilled receipt whose numbers were transcribed rather than
   re-measured is itself a phantom.
3. **Carry an inline `<!-- BACKFILLED by evolve-N at <ts>. <cause>. Metrics re-run live. Article V. -->`
   comment** naming the cause (hand-executed cycle, no row written).
4. **Update `.cycle-highwater`** to match the new row id.
5. **Freeze the plan snapshot** at `facts/.plan-snapshots/<cycle>.md`.
6. **Final check:** `grep -c '^## evolve-<id>' facts/execution-log.md` == 1 AND
   `head -1 facts/harness-state.md` names your cycle.

A cycle that shipped code and left no receipt is indistinguishable, to the user and to the next
Critic, from a cycle that did nothing. The inverse-phantom is worse than the original because the
work is real and the ledger says it never happened.

## Pitfall: compaction into a gitignored dir is silent audit-trail destruction
A Gardener run compacted `critique-log.md` 756→100 and `predictions.md` 236→100 and wrote the
only copies of the 792 removed lines to `facts/.tmp/` — a path double-matched by `.gitignore`
and untracked. 61 KB of append-only history survived only because the deletion was still
uncommitted (HEAD held the last full copy).

Rules for any ledger compaction:
- Archive destination is `facts/history/` (tracked), **never** `facts/.tmp/` or any scratch dir.
- Guard before truncating anything:
  `git check-ignore -q "$ARCHIVE_DIR/probe" && { echo "FATAL: archive dir is gitignored — refusing to compact"; exit 1; }`
- `git add facts/history && git commit` in the SAME run; verify with
  `git ls-files facts/history | wc -l` and `git show HEAD:<archive> | wc -l` before reporting success.
- If you find such a loss already staged, **commit the recovery before anything else** — the next
  `git commit -A` by any harness cron locks it in.

## Pitfall: unset `$cycle` leaking `evolve-0` into user-facing state
`scripts/skill-automation.sh` interpolated `evolve-$cycle` into `harness-state.md` when the cycle
id resolved empty, publishing a nonexistent cycle. Any script writing a cycle id to a user-visible
file must fall back (`grep -oP 'Cycle evolve-\K\d+' "$STATE_FILE" | tail -1`) and **skip the write
with a log line** rather than emit a placeholder. Verify `grep -c 'evolve-0' facts/harness-state.md` == 0.

### evolve-60: THREE new enforcement mechanisms shipped — know they exist before you cycle
The evolve-59 critique (Article II drift — five cycles of instrument hygiene with no user-friction signal) produced three load-bearing additions to `scripts/execution-loop.sh` and `facts/`:

1. **`facts/observation-log.md` — the Article II audit surface.** Created at evolve-60. Records "no new user friction since <last witness>; harness self-referential for evolve-N..M". Any cycle's change must cite a friction source (witness-log, observation-log, or a concrete critique entry) OR the evolve arm aborts. This is the first-class record of the absence of user friction — write to it, don't let it go stale.

   **⚠️ Keep it RECONCILED with witness-log.md — a stale "no friction" claim is counterfactual (evolve-61).** The evolve-60 entry claimed "No new user friction since 2026-08-01" on the very day the harness's own credential-health probe logged `github=401` and witness-log recorded a blocking ACTION-NEEDED. The ground-truth surface silently contradicted the witness log. **Rule: whenever a friction source (witness-log, credential-health) records new friction, append a dated correction entry to observation-log.md stating the prior no-friction claim is SUPERSEDED — never leave the Article II surface asserting an absence that a live signal contradicts.** The Critic flagged this exact staleness; reconcile it the same cycle you notice it.

2. **action-type-by-source (breaks the monoculture).** In `execute_action`, right after `action_type` is parsed, a plan whose `DETAIL:` references instrument code (`execution-loop.sh` or a selftest script) is normalized `facts-cleanup` → `update_script`. `facts-cleanup` is now reserved for plans that only edit `facts/*` prose (audit trail). A 4-cycle facts-cleanup monoculture on one theme is a stagnation signal the Critic flags.

3. **`grounded-plan()` — the Article II start gate.** Runs in the evolve arm right after `read-external-feedback`. A plan is grounded if it EITHER carries an explicit no-op OR cites a friction source (`^WITNESS:`, `^EVIDENCE:`, `^CRITIQUE:`, or mentions `observation-log.md`/`witness-log.md`). Otherwise it aborts rc=2 with `ungrounded plan — no user-friction citation and no Article III no-op`. This makes a cycle that would manufacture backlog to justify itself impossible. **Authoring rule: always include a `WITNESS/EVIDENCE CITATION:` field in `recommendation.md`** — it is now required, not stylistic.

   **⚠️ SUPERSEDED (evolve-61) — the no-op branch must match ONLY the STRUCTURED ledger form.** The evolve-60 gate accepted `noop|no-op|no user friction|result: noop` (a keyword coincidence): any self-referential plan could mention "no user friction" in DETAIL prose, pass the gate (rc=0), and then run a backlog anyway — that is not a no-op. Evolve-61 replaced it with a dedicated `_plan_declares_noop()` that matches **only** `^- (result|Result): *noop` on its own line, and the evolve arm now `return 0` **without calling `execute_action`** when a structured no-op is declared (and writes a `- action: noop` audit row so the refusal is visible). **Rule: a gate's "exempt" branch must match the *structure* of the exemption, never a keyword that can appear incidentally in prose — and a declared no-op must actually skip the work, or it is a no-op in name only.** Proven by selftest cases (u) ungrounded-abort (rc=2) and (v) keyword-coincidence-vs-structured discrimination; suite now 17/17 PASS.

**Pitfall — my own evolve-60 plan hit the gate it ships.** The plan declared a metric `` `grep -c '^## evolve-60' facts/execution-log.md` == 1 `` — the exact self-matching-criterion / "never metric your own cycle's future receipt" class the skill warns about (evolve-59 sub-case, above). The gate caught it live, emitted `SELF-MATCHING CRITERION`, and downgraded the row to `partial(metrics-failed)`. This confirms the guard fires and the correct pattern: **declare metrics that hold BEFORE dispatch (selftest PASS count, a counter present in a script, an assertion name present) — never the receipt's own existence.** The receipt's existence is `_reverify_published_metrics` / `_reverify_prior_cycle`'s job, not a plan metric's. The `partial(metrics-failed)` result for real, committed work is acceptable and honest — report it as the gate working, not as a failure.

**Credential failure triage pattern (useful, not env-specific):** when `credential-health.sh` flags a provider 401, check EVERY backup store before declaring the credential dead — `.env`, `.env.bak`, `.env.bak-<ts>`, AND the tool's own config (e.g. `gh` `hosts.yml`). At evolve-60 the GitHub token was 401 in all four (a genuine expiry). If all are dead, that is an operator-blocked item: log it to `witness-log.md` with severity/impact/fix-required and stop — do not spin cycles trying to self-fix a credential you cannot regenerate. This is the "check the source" discipline of the api-key-rotation pattern applied at the credential-probe layer.

### ⚠️ delta-mode masks REPEATED credential failures — "all probes OK" while a credential is dead (Aug 5, 2026)
`_log_status` in `scripts/credential-health.sh` has a delta-mode that skips re-logging an unchanged status (keeps the log a clean change-history, not 80 lines/day). But the `ALL_OK=false` update was placed AFTER that early return — so a **repeated failure (401→401) hit the return before `ALL_OK` was set**, and the probe printed `credential-health: all probes OK` while the credential stayed dead. The Critic's own operator-blocked item (the GitHub 401) was being silently hidden from the very probe designed to surface it.

**Fix:** set `ALL_OK=false` for a non-200 status BEFORE the delta-mode suppression return, so a repeated failure still flags the probe failed:
```bash
_log_status() {
    ...
    # non-200 must ALWAYS set ALL_OK=false, even when delta-mode suppresses the log write
    if [[ "$status" != "200" ]] && [[ "$status" != "SKIP" ]] \
        && [[ "$status" != "FORMAT_OK" ]] && [[ "$status" != "NO_ACCOUNT" ]] \
        && [[ "$status" != "NO_KEYPAIR" ]] && [[ "$status" != "PAY_OK" ]]; then
        ALL_OK=false
    fi
    # then the delta-mode early return (only suppresses the LOG line, not the flag)
}
```

**Diagnostic signature — how to tell a probe is false-greening without reading the code:** the log's last line for a provider says `| provider=401` but running the probe prints "all probes OK" and exits 0. If the last logged status is a failure and the probe says green, the flag-update is after a suppression return.

**Generalised rule:** a delta/suppression optimization must never sit between a status check and the aggregate flag that consumes it. Suppress the *write*, not the *conclusion*. Same family as the fail-open traps elsewhere in this skill (a path that "records nothing" must not also "conclude nothing").

### evolve-62: the RECEIPT-EXISTS SELF-CHECK class — and the over-broad guard that faked a FAIL
Sixth recurrence of the self-referential-criterion family (after #34/#36/#37/#42/#51). The evolve-61 receipt grew an **undeclared 8th metric** that grepped `facts/execution-log.md` for its own cycle header — `awk '/^## evolve-61/,/^- detail:/' … | grep -c '^## evolve-61'` — which is 1 iff the receipt row was written (it counts its own header, so `== 0` is structurally unpassable). It slipped past the grep-only SELF-MATCHING ban because it was **awk-wrapped**, and it was **plan-authored**, not auto-appended (grep the whole `scripts/` tree for the literal before assuming code injected it).

**The guard (now in `_verify_recommendation_metrics`):** reject an expression that targets `execution-log.md` AND contains a grep for its own cycle header `^## ${CYCLE_ID}`:
```bash
if printf '%s' "$expr" | grep -q 'facts/execution-log\.md' \
   && [[ -n "${CYCLE_ID:-}" ]] \
   && printf '%s' "$expr" | grep -qE "grep[^|]*\^##[[:space:]]*${CYCLE_ID}"; then
    # emit RECEIPT-EXISTS SELF-CHECK, rc=1
fi
```
**⚠️ The guard MUST match the own-header grep signature, NOT any mention of `$CYCLE_ID`.** My first version used `grep -qF "$CYCLE_ID"` and falsely flagged a LEGITIMATE metric — `` awk '/^## evolve-61/,/^## evolve-62/' … | grep -o 'METRIC: [^;]*' `` — where `evolve-62` is only the awk range **END boundary** used to measure the *previous* row. That false FAIL downgraded a correct receipt to `partial(metrics-failed)`. The discriminating signature is `grep … '^## <owncycle>'` (the receipt header literal), NOT the presence of the id anywhere. **Rule: a guard against a self-referential class must key on the class's *signature* (grep for own header), not on a token that appears incidentally in legitimate expressions.**

### evolve-62: the `row_published` counter is PIPE-BLIND — write plan metrics in countable form
`_reverify_published_metrics` counts published metrics with the prose-immune regex `METRIC: [^|;]+ -> ` — the `[^|;]` character class means **any metric whose expression contains a pipe (`|`) or semicolon (`;`) is invisible to it**. The evolve-62 plan declared 5 metrics but 2 used pipes (`awk … | grep … | wc -l` and the `awk 'BEGIN{while((…|getline …'` wrapper), so the row published only 3 countable tokens and the re-verifier fired `PLAN MUTATED`-style noise at the cycle boundary.

**Authoring rule: express every plan metric in a pipe-free, semicolon-free form so the prose-immune counter can see it.** Two workarounds that reproduce cleanly:
- selftest PASS count: `grep -c '^PASS: ' <(bash scripts/selftest-X.sh 2>&1)` (process substitution, no pipe) — NOT the `awk … |getline` wrapper.
- count of `METRIC:` tokens in a prior row: `awk '/^## evolve-N/,/^## evolve-M/{n+=gsub(/METRIC: /,"")} END{print n+0}'` (awk `gsub` increments `n`, no pipe) — NOT `awk … | grep -o … | wc -l`.
Pre-flight before dispatch: run each expression through `printf 'METRIC: %s -> 1 [PASS]' "<expr>" | grep -oE 'METRIC: [^|;]+ -> '` and confirm it matches (COUNTABLE); any that don't must be rewritten before the loop, or the next re-verifier flags a false PLAN MUTATED.

**Repairing a receipt that shipped a false FAIL:** when a dispatch lands `partial(metrics-failed)` because an *over-broad guard* (or a plan-authored degenerate metric) flagged a metric that actually passes, repair the row **in place** — flip `- result:` to `ok`, correct the offending metric's `[FAIL …]` annotation to its true `[PASS …]`, and delete any stale `<!-- METRIC SHIFT … -->`/`<!-- PLAN MUTATED … -->` comments that reference the removed criterion. A false FAIL is as corrosive as a false PASS: it makes `partial(metrics-failed)` uninformative. Re-run every metric live against the working tree before repairing, exactly as for a backfill.

### Stale sentinel from an ABORTED (not dispatched) run is safe to clear
The evolve-62 run that aborted at the must_act gate (unaddressed high critique) left a `facts/.dispatch-sentinels/dispatched-evolve-62` with **no** matching `^## evolve-62` ledger row, which then blocked re-entry with `DISPATCH ALREADY RUNNING … refusing re-entry`. The existing rule says clear a sentinel only when its cycle has a RESOLVED receipt row — but that loop leaves an aborted-cycle sentinel (no row) in place forever, deadlocking the very cycle that must run to address the critique. **Refinement: a sentinel with NO matching ledger row that was created by YOUR OWN aborted pre-flight this session is safe to clear** (`rm -f facts/.dispatch-sentinels/dispatched-evolve-N` after confirming `grep -c '^## evolve-N' facts/execution-log.md` == 0 and the high-water hasn't advanced past N). The 3h floor exists to stop a *completed* cycle from double-dispatching; an aborted one that never wrote a row cannot double-dispatch. Verify the high-water before clearing — if it advanced, the cycle did dispatch and the sentinel must stay.

### ⚠️ credential-health.sh "all probes OK" can be a FALSE READING — delta-mode masks a repeated 401
`_log_status` (credential-health.sh:54-58) runs in **delta mode**: it skips logging when the
provider's *last logged* status equals the current one (`if [[ "$last_status" == "$status" ]]; then
return 0`). That `return 0` fires BEFORE the `ALL_OK=false` flip at lines 61-65. So when a credential
was 401 on the previous probe and is STILL 401 on the next one, the current probe never reaches the
`ALL_OK=false` line and the script exits 0 printing `credential-health: all probes OK` — **grading a
stale, still-broken failure as success.**

Seen live (Aug 5, 2026): `gh auth status` clearly failed ("token in hosts.yml is invalid", exit 1),
every token store tested 401, yet `bash scripts/credential-health.sh` printed `all probes OK` and
appended a `# Last verified: 09:41:52Z` line with no 401 entry — because 401 was already the last
logged GitHub status and the delta-mode early-return swallowed the repetition. Confirm with
`bash -x scripts/credential-health.sh 2>&1 | grep -iE 'github|401|200'`: you'll see `_log_status
github 401` then the early-return `[[ 401 == 401 ]]` short-circuit before `ALL_OK=false`.

**Verification rule — never trust the probe's summary line; reproduce the check yourself.**
When the user says they updated a credential (e.g. "we updated tokens yesterday"), the harness probe
is NOT sufficient evidence. Directly test the live value against the upstream API:
```bash
# for a GitHub token (probe reads ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml via `gh auth status`, after unset GITHUB_TOKEN):
TOK=$(sed -n 's/^[[:space:]]*oauth_token:[[:space:]]*//p' <profile-home>/.config/gh/hosts.yml | head -1)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" https://api.github.com/user
gh auth status   # probe reads this; exit 1 + "token is invalid" = still broken
```
And test EVERY store, because an update can land in one place the harness doesn't read: `.env`,
`.env.bak`, `.env.bak-<ts>`, each profile's `.env` (gizmo, gentech-treasury, etc.), and each
`gh hosts.yml` (profile home + /root). Also `stat -c '%y'` each store to see whether the update
actually touched the file the probe reads. The probe does NOT read `.env`'s `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

**Root-cause fix (durable):** the ALL_OK flag must be computed from the *observed* status, not only
set on a status *change*. Move the delta-mode early return AFTER the flag update, or derive the flag
from the live check independent of logging. As written, a persistent failure and a fresh success
produce the same "all probes OK" — the probe cannot distinguish them. If fixing, add a selftest that
runs the probe twice against a still-failing store and asserts exit != 0.

### ⚠️ GitHub token store gotchas found while triaging the 401 (Aug 5, 2026)
Two traps trip up "propagate the fresh token" far more often than the expiry itself:

1. **`gh auth login --with-token` writes a BROKEN empty-username entry when a stale user already
   exists in hosts.yml.** Running `printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | gh auth login --with-token` against a
   hosts.yml that already has a `ProtoJay4789:` entry leaves BOTH the stale invalid entry AND a
   new `"":` empty-username entry. `gh auth status` then shows the OLD invalid token, and `gh api`
   runs unauthenticated (the 60/60 core rate-limit view). The command cannot replace an existing
   entry cleanly. **The reliable fix is to rewrite `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` directly with exactly
   one valid entry:**
   ```
   github.com:
       users:
           GentechLabs:
               oauth_token: <TOKEN>
       user: GentechLabs
       oauth_token: <TOKEN>
       git_protocol: https
   ```
   Verify after: `gh auth status` shows `✓ Logged in ... account GentechLabs` and
   `gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources.core.limit'` returns `5000` (the authenticated view), not `60`.

2. **A 403 "API rate limit exceeded" is NOT an invalid token.** A token that authenticates — the
   response carries `x-github-authentication-token-expiration` and a user ID that resolves — but
   returns `403 {message: API rate limit exceeded for user ID ...}` has exhausted its REST quota;
   it is still valid. Distinguish from 401 (bad credential) by the error body and the presence of
   the expiration header. The core quota resets hourly (`gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources.core.reset'`).
   Critically: **`git push` over HTTPS uses the git smart-HTTP protocol, which is SEPARATE from the
   REST API quota — so pushes succeed even while REST reads (`gh api`, notifications, `gh auth status`
   rate_limit) are 403.** Don't wait for the reset to push queued work; only API reads are throttled.
   This is why a repo can be stuck (stale embedded token in its `origin` URL) while a freshly-set
   `git remote set-url` pushes cleanly despite the 403s.

### ⚠️ A DIAGNOSTIC pre-flight can be a SILENT HARD GATE — `set -euo pipefail` kills the cycle
(evolve-61) The pre-flight `bash credential-health.sh 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do log "$line"; done`
was written to *diagnose* credentials, but under `set -euo pipefail` a non-zero probe exit aborted the
**entire cycle before `execute_action`** — so the known `github=401` silently stopped every evolution
dispatch, every 4 hours, with no ledger row and the last log line being the probe's own summary.
A diagnostic check that blocks the work it is supposed to accompany is not a check, it is a fuse.

**Fix shape — capture the status with `||`, never let the diagnostic gate dispatch:**
```bash
local _ch_rc=0
bash scripts/credential-health.sh 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do log "$line"; done \
  || _ch_rc=${PIPESTATUS[0]:-0}
log "credential-health pre-flight exited ${_ch_rc} (advisory — not gating dispatch)"
```
Note BOTH halves matter: the `||`-capture (because a bare `x=$(...); _ch_rc=$?` is the `set -e` lie —
`$?` is never read when the command fails), AND `PIPESTATUS[0]` (the probe's status, not the `while`
reader's — the reader always exits 0).

**Generalised rule: separate "can we proceed" from "what's the health report". A probe whose purpose
is to *report* a known-blocked state (operator will fix it) must never be a *hard gate* on unrelated
work. If a known-broken credential is allowed to halt all evolution cycles, one outage makes the
harness blind to everything else.** This is the mirror image of the credential-tri
age rule: flag it, log it to `witness-log.md` as operator-blocked, and let the cycle continue — a
blocked credential degrades one capability, not the whole harness.

## Operator-blocked items
When the only open user-facing friction requires the operator (e.g. Pay wallet `NO_ACCOUNT` / CLI not installed), do NOT spin cycles on log repairs to justify existence (Article III: the harness may remain silent). Write a dated decision block into `witness-log.md` with numbered options + a stated default, surface it in the report, and stop.

### credential-health delta-mode masks repeated failures (Aug 5, 2026)
`_log_status()` early-returns on an unchanged status BEFORE setting `ALL_OK=false`, so a repeated 401 (401→401) is deduped from the log but also never flips `ALL_OK` — the probe reports "all probes OK" while the credential is dead. Fix: set `ALL_OK=false` for non-OK before the delta return. Full trace + generalised rule: `references/credential-health-delta-mode.md`.
