# Model Configuration Management

Systematic approach to managing model configurations and preventing model switching errors in Gentech systems.

## Problem Context

Common issue: Configured models that don't exist in live catalogs cause unexpected fallback switching. Example: `glm-4.5-flash` was set as default but doesn't exist in Z.AI's API, causing automatic switches to `glm-4.7` or `glm-5.2`.

## Model Validation Protocol

### 1. Catalog Verification

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY (Jul 3, 2026):** The `/models` endpoint returns a platform-wide list, NOT account-specific access. A model appearing in the catalog does NOT mean you have access to it. Real access must be verified via actual API calls.

Before setting a model as default, verify it works with your account:

```bash
# Test specific model availability via actual API call
curl -s -X POST "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "glm-4.7", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test"}], "max_tokens": 10}'

# Expected responses:
# - 200 OK: Model works for your account
# - 429/1113: Quota exhausted or rate limited
# - 401: Token expired or invalid
```

### 2. Account-Specific Model List

```bash
# Get models available to YOUR account (via models endpoint)
curl -s "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Note:** This still shows platform models. Cross-reference with API test results to confirm what you can actually use.

### 2. Configuration Validation
After making changes, validate the configuration:

```bash
# Check current config
grep -A 5 -B 5 "default:" ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml

# Verify model exists in provider catalog
curl -s "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models" | jq -r '.data[].id' | grep "z-ai/glm-4.7"
```

## Approved Z.AI Models

| Model ID | Context Length | Use Case | Cost Efficiency |
|----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| `z-ai/glm-4.7` | 8K tokens | Default, balanced reasoning | ★★★★☆ |
| `z-ai/glm-5.2` | 16K tokens | Complex tasks, max context | ★★★☆☆ |
| `z-ai/glm-4.7-flash` | 8K tokens | Fast processing, latency-sensitive | ★★★★☆ |
| `z-ai/glm-4.5` | 4K tokens | Simple tasks, minimal context | ★★★★☆ |

## Same-Provider Fallback Preference (Jul 17, 2026)

**Rule:** When a model is unavailable, find the best equivalent FROM THE SAME PROVIDER before switching to a different provider. This prevents config drift, provider fragmentation, and unexpected fallthrough chains.

**BUT: a fallback chain must never be the same provider+model+base_url as the primary.** A fallback that is byte-identical to the primary is a retry, not a fallback — it cannot fail over and leaves the rail with no safety net. Verify the fallback chain is a *different* provider or a *different* reset cycle by reading the raw config; do not trust the length of the fallback list. A one-entry fallback that repeats the primary is worse than no fallback at all, because it hides the missing safety net. (Measured live 2026-10-01: all four profiles carried `fallback_providers: [{provider: opencode-go, model: deepseek-v4-flash}]` against a primary of `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash` — one credential pool behind both, so a single quota event takes the worker and its "fallback" together.)

**Example — OpenCode Go fallback order:**
```
deepseek-v4-pro unavailable → kimi-k2.7-code (same provider) → glm-5.2 (same provider)
→ deepseek-v4-flash (same provider) → THEN fallback to another provider
```

**Why same-provider first:**
- One subscription = one billing surface. No surprise costs from fallthrough to a different provider.
- Prevents the OpenRouter auto-routing problem where Hermes falls through to unmonitored providers.
- Consistent API format — model IDs without provider prefixes.
- Cleaner diagnostics — one endpoint to check when something breaks.

**Implementation in Hermes config:**
```yaml
fallback_providers:
  - provider: opencode-go
    model: deepseek-v4-flash        # Same provider, cheaper fallback
```
Set the fallback explicitly to the same provider. Do NOT add other providers to the fallback chain unless the primary provider is unreachable entirely.

## Fallback Strategy (Updated Jul 17, 2026)

When a configured model is unavailable:

1. **Same-Provider Fallback**: Find the best equivalent from the same provider
2. **Cross-Provider Fallback**: Only after exhausting same-provider options
3. **Configuration Update**: Permanently update the config to prevent repeated failures
4. **Notification**: Log the change for audit purposes

## ⚠️ A runtime switch is NOT a config change — verify the FILE, not the session

**Changing the model/provider mid-session only affects that session.** The `config.yaml` files still
read the old provider, so the next gateway restart silently reverts everything and the "switch" never
took effect. When the user says *"we're switching back to X"*, that is a CONFIG task until proven
otherwise — check the files before agreeing it is done.

**Verify at the file, then at the resolved value:**
```bash
for p in <profiles>; do
  printf "%-18s " "$p"
  python3 -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('REDACTED-PROFILES_DIR/$p/config.yaml'));\
print(d['model'].get('provider'), (d.get('fallback_providers') or [{}])[0].get('provider'))"
done
```

**Count the aux roles too — a provider switch is never just the primary model.** Compare the count of
slots still on the OLD provider against the total; a partial sweep that leaves 10 aux roles behind
leaves web reading, vision, compression and session search broken while chat keeps working, which is
exactly the failure that hides longest.

## ⚠️ ollama-cloud is a BUILT-IN provider — do not author a provider block for it

`ollama-cloud` is registered natively (auth provider table, keyed by `OLLAMA_API_KEY`). It needs **no
`providers:` entry** — only `model.provider: ollama-cloud` and the key present in the profile `.env`.

**Do not conclude it is "missing" because `grep '^  ollama-cloud:' config.yaml` returns nothing**, and
do not "restore" a block for it. Confirming it is built-in: it appears in the CLI's provider list and
in the model-normalisation module. Distinguish a built-in provider (re-point only) from a
user-declared one (needs a `providers:` block) BEFORE editing — conflating them produces either a
redundant duplicate block or a hunt for something that was never missing.

## ⚠️ Scripted config rewrites: parse-check the CANDIDATE before writing

**A script that rewrites config can write a file that SCANS but does not PARSE, and that is a hard
outage.** Measured: an automated provider-switch emitted a `fallback_providers` sequence without its
leading indent and left a live config unparseable (`mapping values are not allowed here`). The write
is the only irreversible step, so make it the last thing that can happen:

1. **Build the new text, then `yaml.safe_load` the CANDIDATE STRING.** Refuse to write if it does not
   parse.
2. **Re-read the resolved values from the parsed result and assert they equal what you intended** — a
   valid file with the wrong values is a silent failure, and it still landed on disk.
3. **Back up first, timestamped, never overwritten** — the restore path turns a corrupt write into a
   two-minute fix instead of an outage.
4. **Line-level edits only.** Never round-trip through parse/serialise: re-emitting a large config
   reformats it and destroys comments (`yaml.dump` has already silently merged provider entries).
5. **Match the indent exactly.** YAML nesting is load-bearing: `fallback_providers` needs its dash
   indented two spaces (fields at four); `auxiliary:` roles sit at two with fields at four. **A regex
   written for the wrong depth matches NOTHING and reports "no changes needed"** — a silent no-op on
   precisely the entries that matter. Print the match count per target block and confirm it is non-zero;
   never trust the summary line alone.
6. **Remap model names along with the provider.** The model ids are provider-specific: repointing a
   slot without remapping its model yields a config that parses clean and 404s at call time. Check each
   aux model against the target provider's catalogue, not just the provider field.
7. **Probe the target with a real completion** before calling the run successful, and note in the
   output that changes take effect on the **next gateway restart** — a gateway cannot restart itself
   from inside its own process.

The reusable script for the primary+fallback+aux switch fleet-wide:
`00-System/agent-profiles/switch_to_ollama_cloud.py` (`--dry-run` first, then apply).

## ⚠️ A stale uncommitted patch in the install is discarded by the next update

**Before updating a checkout, read its uncommitted modifications — do not assume they are disposable.**
A live install carried a 23-line uncommitted fix; the update would have discarded it silently, and the
fix was **not** upstream (confirmed by reading the upstream revision of that file, not by assuming).

```bash
git -C <install> status --short
git -C <install> diff <file> > <vault>/patches/<topic>-<purpose>.patch
sha256sum <patch>                                  # make the preservation verifiable
git -C <install> show origin/main:<file> | grep -n <symbol>   # is it already upstream?
```

If upstream has since fixed the same defect, the local edit is redundant and keeping it fights the new
code. If it has not, the patch is a real fix that must survive. **"Uncommitted" does not mean
"disposable"** — and a dirty tree also blocks some update paths, so resolve it deliberately rather than
being stopped by it.

**The mirror-image check: a patch saved in the vault that was never APPLIED is just as silent.** A clean
install tree proves only that nothing is *at risk* — it does not prove the fix is *live*. Check the
direction too:

```bash
git -C <install> apply --reverse --check <patch>   # succeeds ONLY if the change is present
```

Measured 2026-09-21: an install was clean (**0** modified entries) while a preserved patch was **not**
applied — so neither the dirty-tree check nor the patch file existing would have revealed it. Read
`git status` *and* verify the patch landed, because "I saved it" and "it is running" are different
claims. If the defect it fixes has since been fixed upstream in another form, say so by probing the
behaviour rather than by assuming either way.

Also: `git show origin/main:<file>` assumes `main`. Use the repo's actual default branch, and
`git fetch` first, or the comparison silently reads a stale ref and can make a local fix look upstream
when it is not.

## Providers vs `custom_providers` — When to Use Each

Hermes has **two distinct patterns** for adding LLM providers. Choosing the wrong one causes config drift, gateway crashes, or silent routing through unintended providers.

### Pattern A: `providers` section (recommended for most cases)

Add a provider entry under `providers:` when you want models from that endpoint **available as options** — the main model can switch to them by name without changing the primary provider.

```yaml
providers:
  zyloo:                                     # ← Any name, used as provider reference
    api_key: ${ZYLOO_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://api.zyloo.io/v1
    type: openai_compatible                  # ← OpenAI-compatible = works out of box

model:
  default: deepseek-v4-flash                 # Still the primary model
  provider: nous                             # Still the primary provider
```

**When to use this pattern:**
- You want to keep the main provider (nous, opencode-go, etc.) but add **extra model sources** for fallback, testing, or one-off use
- You're adding an OpenAI-compatible endpoint as a secondary option
- You want the agent to be able to `/model` switch to one of the provider's models
- No gateway restart needed for cron jobs using the main provider

**This is how ZAI, OpenCode Go, and Zyloo are added** — as providers entries, not custom_providers.

### Pattern B: `custom_providers` + `provider: custom` (for replacing the primary)

Set `model.provider: custom` and add a `custom_providers` entry when you want the **entire agent** to use a single non-built-in provider as its primary inference source.

```yaml
model:
  default: zyloo/claude-fable-5
  provider: custom                           # ← Switches to custom_providers mode

custom_providers:
  - name: zyloo
    api_key: ${ZYLOO_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://api.zyloo.io/v1
    type: openai_compatible
    model: zyloo/claude-fable-5
```

**When to use this pattern:**
- You want to make a non-built-in provider the **primary/only** inference source
- You're setting up a Telegram gateway that exclusively uses this provider
- The provider is NOT in the built-in `providers:` section

**⚠️ Critical:** every profile using `provider: custom` MUST have its own `custom_providers` section. It is NOT inherited from global config. Missing it causes `No LLM provider configured` (exit code 75) on gateway startup.

**⚠️ Stale `custom_providers` is a routing hijack vector:** old entries from past setups persist indefinitely and can cause silent routing to dead endpoints years later. Audit regularly:
```bash
grep -A 4 "^custom_providers:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml || echo "No custom_providers"
```

### Decision Matrix

| You want to... | Use Pattern |
|---|---|
| Add Zyloo as an extra model source alongside Nous | A — `providers` section |
| Switch entire Gentech to Zyloo models | B — `custom_providers` |
| Keep default on Nous, test a Zyloo model occasionally | A — `providers` section |
| Set up a new Telegram gateway on Zyloo only | B — `custom_providers` |

## Provider Catalog URLs

- **OpenRouter**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`
- **Z.AI**: Via OpenRouter (direct API returns 404)
- **Anthropic**: Via OpenRouter
- **OpenAI**: Via OpenRouter
- **Ollama Cloud**: `https://ollama.com/v1/models` (then verify each model with `POST /v1/chat/completions`)

## Ollama Cloud Catalog Verification

Ollama Cloud publishes many models, but your subscription plan determines which ones are available. The catalog endpoint lists every model on the platform; a model appearing there does not prove your account can run it. The only reliable verification is a live chat-completion probe with a real token budget.

**Pitfall — small `max_tokens` makes a working model look broken.** Reasoning models (glm-5.3-flash, glm-5.2, kimi-k3, nemotron-3-*) spend tokens on a separate `reasoning` or `reasoning_content` field before emitting content. With `max_tokens` set too low (≤64), the response returns HTTP 200 with EMPTY `content` and `finish_reason: length`. That is a flawed instrument, not a failing model. Always live-test with at least `max_tokens: 512` and inspect both `message.content` and `message.reasoning`/`reasoning_content`.

**Distinguish a DEAD key from a CAPPED rail — they look alike from a single probe.** A weekly-limit response is `200` on `/api/usage` with real account data and a `429`/`api_error` on `/v1/chat/completions`; a missing/revoked key is `401` on `/api/usage`. Measured 2026-10-01: with our key, `/api/usage` → 200 (weekly usage full) while a chat completion → *"you have reached your weekly usage limit"*. A note had recorded this rail as "cancelled, key dead" — both wrong, and the wrong call would have deleted a valid credential. **Probe the key with a control (`/api/usage` with and without the Authorization header) before concluding a rail is gone.**

**Recommended probe:**
```bash
KEY=$(grep '^OLLAMA_API_KEY=' ~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
for m in deepseek-v4.1-flash glm-5.3-flash kimi-k2.7-code glm-5.2 kimi-k3; do
  echo -n "$m: "
  curl -s --max-time 60 -X POST https://ollama.com/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ***" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$m\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply exactly: OK\"}],\"max_tokens\":512}" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); c=(d.get('choices') or [{}])[0].get('message',{}); print(repr(c.get('content','')[:30]), 'reasoning=', bool(c.get('reasoning') or c.get('reasoning_content')))"
done
```

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Bad Pattern
```yaml
model:
  default: glm-4.5-flash  # Doesn't exist
  provider: zai
```

### ✅ Good Pattern  
```yaml
model:
  default: glm-4.7  # Exists in catalog
  provider: zai
## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Common Mistake: Using model names without provider prefixes
- Use `z-ai/glm-4.7` not just `glm-4.7`
- Provider-prefixed names ensure unambiguous routing

### ⚠️ Performance-Based Switching (Sep 2026)

**Discovery:** User experienced frequent reprompting and resets with Nvidia Nemotron models, indicating suboptimal performance for agent workflows despite capability.

**Symptoms indicating model switch needed:**
- Having to reprompt 2-3 times to get desired output
- Resetting conversation to clear context
- Model ignoring instructions or going off-track
- Excessive token usage for simple tasks

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Use high-capability models (Nvidia Nemotron) as backup only** - for when you hit usage limits on primary
2. **Primary models should be efficient, instruction-following models** like DeepSeek V4 Flash or GLM-5.3-Flash
3. **Test alternatives** on Ollama Cloud/OpenCode Go before committing
4. **Monitor interaction quality** - if you're frequently fighting the model, switch

**Verification for DeepSeek V4 Flash as Nvidia Alternative:**
```bash
# Test on Ollama Cloud
curl -s -X POST https://ollama.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLLAMA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Explain agent commerce in one sentence"}],"max_tokens":20}'

# Test on OpenCode Go
curl -s -X POST https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Explain agent commerce in one sentence"}],"max_tokens":20}'
```

**Cost/Performance Comparison:**
| Model | Provider | Avg. Reprompts Needed | Cost per 1M tokens |
|-------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| nemotron- nemotron-3-super | Ollama Cloud | 2-3 (observed) | Free (Ollama Cloud) |
| deepseek-v4-flash | Ollama Cloud | 0-1 (target) | Free tier |
| deepseek-v4-flash | OpenCode Go | 0-1 (target) | $0.22/$0.66 |
| glm-5.3-flash | OpenCode Go | 0-1 (target) | $0.07/$0.25 |

### Z.AI Provider Configuration Pattern

**Required Configuration Block:**

```yaml
providers:
  zai:
    api_key: ${ZAI_API_KEY}  # ← MUST be set in environment
    base_url: https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4

model:
  default: deepseek-v4-flash  # or your preferred model
  provider: zai
```

**Environment Variable Setup:**

```bash
# Add to ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/.env
ZAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here

# Or via hermes config (recommended)
hermes config set ZAI_API_KEY "your_key_here"
```

### OpenCode Go Provider Configuration

**Gentech Standard:** OpenCode Go is the preferred provider for DeepSeek Flash and GLM 5.2. It bundles both models under a single subscription.

**CRITICAL: Base URL Must Be Correct**
The OpenCode Go API is at `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`, NOT `https://api.opencode.com`. The latter does NOT resolve (DNS lookup fails). Any config referencing `api.opencode.com` will silently fail.

**Nous Provider Base URL (same failure class — Jul 30, 2026):**
`providers.nous.base_url` MUST be `https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1` (the inference endpoint). `https://api.nousresearch.com` is the OAuth/portal host — it does NOT resolve for chat completions and produces `APIConnectionError` after 3 retries, even though `hermes config get model` reports `provider: nous` correctly. `auth.json` already stores the right value as `inference_base_url: https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1`; mirror it into the provider block. At runtime the agent resolves the host from `providers.nous.base_url`, so fixing only the `model:` block's `base_url` (as in Step 5 of the Fallthrough cleanup below) is NOT enough. Field symptom: gateway shows Telegram `connected` but every HQ reply throws "unexpected error" / "provider failed after retries" — that is agent-side inference failure, not transport.

**Correct OpenCode Go config block:**
```yaml
providers:
  opencode-go:
    api_key: ${OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1  # ← CORRECT endpoint
    type: openai_compatible
```

**Model IDs on OpenCode Go API:**
Use these model IDs at the `opencode.ai/zen/go/v1` endpoint:
| Model | Model ID | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Kimi K2.7 Code | `kimi-k2.7-code` | Thinking-based (reasoning tokens). ~1,350 req per 5h on Go plan |
| Kimi K3 | `kimi-k3` | Flagship. Open weights Jul 27. ~140 req per 5h on Go plan |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro | `deepseek-v4-pro` | 1.6T MoE, 1M ctx. ~3,450 req per 5h |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Daily driver. ~31,650 req per 5h |
| GLM-5.2 | `glm-5.2` | Expert coding. ~880 req per 5h |

In Hermes config, model IDs use the format `opencode-go/<model-id>` (e.g. `opencode-go/kimi-k2.7-code`).

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/.env
OPCODE_GO_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

**Pitfall: Empty Provider Block**

If you set `provider: opencode-go` but the `providers.opencode-go` line is empty (`opencode-go: ''`), Hermes cannot resolve the connection.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check provider block
grep -A 5 "^providers:" ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml

# Check env var
echo $OPCODE_GO_API_KEY
```

**Resolution:**
1. Set `OPCODE_GO_API_KEY` in environment or `.env` file
2. Restart Hermes gateway
3. Verify connection with `hermes config show`

**Provider Preference Order (Gentech):**
1. **OpenCode Go** (DeepSeek Flash, GLM 5.2) — daily driver
2. **Z.AI** (GLM 4.7) — alternative when OpenCode unavailable
3. **OpenRouter** — fallback for cross-provider access

**Pitfall: Missing Provider Configuration**

**Symptom:**
- Provider set to `zai` but connections fail
- Falls back to OpenRouter or errors out
- No obvious error message in logs

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if providers.zai exists
grep -A 3 "^providers:" ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml

# Check if env var is set
echo $ZAI_API_KEY
```

**Root Cause:**
- `providers.zai` block missing from config.yaml
- `${ZAI_API_KEY}` not set in environment
- Hermes can't resolve the provider connection

**Resolution:**
1. Add `providers.zai` block to config.yaml (requires `hermes config edit` or manual edit)
2. Set `ZAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Restart Hermes gateway

**Example Manual Provider Configuration:**

When `hermes config set` doesn't update the providers section, you may need to edit the config file manually. Here's the correct structure:

```yaml
providers:
  nous:
    base_url: https://api.nousresearch.com
    client_id: nous-research
    client_secret: ''
    type: oauth
  opencode-go:
    api_key: ${OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1  # ← CORRECT endpoint (NOT opencode.ai/zen/go/v1)
    type: openai_compatible
  ollama:
    base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
    default_model: llama3.1:8b
    discover_models: false
    models: '["llama3.1:8b"]'
    name: Ollama Local
    transport: openai_chat
  zai:
    api_key: ${ZAI_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4

model:
  default: deepseek-v4-flash
  provider: opencode-go
```

**Environment Variables Setup:**

Add keys to `~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/.env`:

```bash
# Z.AI (for GLM 5.2, GLM 4.7)
ZAI_API_KEY=your_zai_token_here

# OpenCode Go (for DeepSeek Flash, GLM 5.2)
OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY=your_opencode_go_token_here
```

**Pitfall: Manual Config File Reassembly**

The `hermes config set` commands update the flat config structure but don't always update nested provider blocks correctly. When you need to modify the providers section:

1. Backup the config: `cp ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml.backup`
2. Edit the file manually or use sed/python to reassemble the providers section
3. Verify the structure with `hermes config show | grep -A 10 "providers:"`
4. Restart Hermes gateway

### Auxiliary Model Configuration

**Problem:** Auxiliary tasks (web_extract, compression, skills_hub, etc.) still reference old models after main model is updated.

**CRITICAL: `/model` Slash Command Only Updates Primary Model**

The `/model` slash command in Telegram only changes the primary model. It does NOT update:
- Auxiliary models (web_extract, compression, skills_hub, approval, mcp, triage_specifier, curator, session_search)
- Vision model
- MOA presets (mixture of agents configuration)
- Fallback providers

**Symptoms:**
- Rate limiting errors from unexpected provider routing
- Inconsistent model behavior across different task types
- Silent routing through OpenRouter or old providers

**Root Cause:** Hermes has 3+ model routing layers. Changing one leaves the others pointing to old config.

**Complete Model Update Pattern (When Switching Providers):**

```bash
# 1. Update primary model
hermes config set model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set provider opencode-go

# 2. Update ALL auxiliary models
hermes config set web_extract_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set web_extract_provider opencode-go

hermes config set compression_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set compression_provider opencode-go

hermes config set skills_hub_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set skills_hub_provider opencode-go

hermes config set approval_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set approval_provider opencode-go

hermes config set mcp_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set mcp_provider opencode-go

hermes config set triage_specifier_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set triage_specifier_provider opencode-go

hermes config set curator_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set curator_provider opencode-go

hermes config set session_search_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set session_search_provider opencode-go

# 3. Update vision model
hermes config set vision_provider opencode-go
hermes config set vision_model gpt-4o

# 4. Update MOA presets (multi-agent orchestration)

**Verification After Update:**

# Check primary model
hermes config show | grep -A 2 "Model:"

# Check auxiliary models (sample)
sed -n '/^auxiliary:/,/^[a-z]/p' ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml | grep -E "(provider|model):" | head -20

# Check for any lingering OpenRouter references
grep -i "openrouter" ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml

# Check MOA presets
sed -n '/^moa:/,/^skills:/p' ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml | grep -E "(provider|model):"

# Verify providers section
sed -n '/^providers:/,/^fallback_providers:/p' ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml
```

**Check Status:**
```bash
hermes config show | grep -A 20 "auxiliary:"

# Or inspect the auxiliary section directly
sed -n '/^auxiliary:/,/^[a-z]/p' ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml | head -60
```

**Update Pattern:**
```bash
# Update BOTH model and provider for each auxiliary model
hermes config set web_extract_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set web_extract_provider opencode-go

hermes config set compression_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set compression_provider opencode-go

hermes config set skills_hub_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set skills_hub_provider opencode-go

hermes config set approval_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set approval_provider opencode-go

hermes config set mcp_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set mcp_provider opencode-go

hermes config set triage_specifier_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set triage_specifier_provider opencode-go

hermes config set curator_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set curator_provider opencode-go

hermes config set session_search_model deepseek-v4-flash
hermes config set session_search_provider opencode-go
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Quick check of auxiliary models
hermes config show | grep "Auxiliary Models" -A 10

# Or detailed inspection
sed -n '/^auxiliary:/,/^[a-z]/p' ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml | grep -E "(provider|model):" | head -20
```

**Note:** The `hermes config show` command only shows the first few auxiliary models in summary view. Use `sed` or `grep` directly on the config file to verify all settings.

**Pitfall — `auxiliary.vision.base_url` survives a provider/model flip (Sep 7, 2026):** When you switch auxiliary slots to a new provider via `hermes config set auxiliary.<slot>.provider/.model`, any slot that carries an explicit `base_url` keeps the OLD provider's URL. In practice this bites `auxiliary.vision` — after flipping `auxiliary.vision.provider` + `.model` to ollama-cloud, the `base_url` still read `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`, so vision kept routing to the old host. Always re-point it explicitly:
```bash
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.base_url "https://ollama.com/v1" --force
```
Verify with `grep -A6 "^auxiliary:" config.yaml` that provider, model, AND base_url all match the new provider.

**Pitfall — top-level shorthand keys need `--force`:** The flat keys (`web_extract_model`, `web_extract_provider`, `session_search_model`, etc.) are NOT recognized config keys — `hermes config set` warns "not a recognized config key — it was saved anyway" and may not persist. Use `--force` for those, and remember the authoritative source is the nested `auxiliary.<slot>` block (the flat keys are a legacy bridge). After any aux sweep, verify BOTH the nested block and the flat keys agree.

**CRITICAL: Vision Config Hierarchy Override**

**Pitfall:** Clearing root-level vision settings does NOT disable vision if `auxiliary.vision` is still configured. AND manual edits to auxiliary.vision are error-prone.

**Discovery (Jul 5, 2026):** The correct way to update auxiliary.vision is via `hermes config set` with dot notation:

```bash
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.provider zai
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.model glm-4.7
```

This updates the nested auxiliary section directly and is safer than manual file editing or flat appends.

**What doesn't work:**
- Manual editing of config.yaml (easy to miss lines, sed deletions risky)
- Appending flat settings to file end (works but creates config drift)
- Setting root-level `vision_provider`/`vision_model` (doesn't override auxiliary)

**Why dot notation works:**
- Updates the exact nested structure Hermes expects
- No risk of breaking YAML syntax
- Idempotent - can run multiple times safely
- Creates a single source of truth for auxiliary config

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check auxiliary.vision section
grep -A 6 "auxiliary:" ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml | grep -A 5 "vision:"

# Should show:
#   vision:
#     provider: zai
#     model: glm-4.7
```

**Lesson:** Always use `hermes config set auxiliary.<section>.provider <provider>` for auxiliary models, not manual edits.

**Pitfall: Vision Fail with "Unknown Model" Across All Providers (Jul 5, 2026)**

**Discovery (Jul 5, 2026):** The CORRECT fix for vision configuration is using dot notation with hermes config set:

```bash
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.provider zai
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.model glm-4.7
```

This updates the authoritative auxiliary section directly. Do NOT use:
- Manual config file editing (sed deletions, nano edits)
- Flat appends to config end
- Root-level overrides only (vision_provider/vision_model)

**Why dot notation works:**
- Updates the exact nested structure Hermes expects
- No risk of YAML syntax errors or broken indentation
- Idempotent - safe to run multiple times
- Single source of truth for auxiliary config

**Session transcript:** See `references/auxiliary-vision-fix-2026-07-05.md` for full investigation path.

**Symptom:**
- Vision consistently fails with `Error code: 400 - 1211: Unknown Model, please check the model code`
- Error persists across multiple provider configurations:
  - `opencode-go` with `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`
  - `openai` with `gpt-4o`
  - `nous` with `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`
- Error occurs even with empty `vision_model` (should use provider default)
- Config changes have no effect - `auxiliary.vision` removal doesn't fix it

**What was tried:**
1. ✅ Removed `auxiliary.vision` section from config.yaml
2. ✅ Cleared root-level `vision_provider` and `vision_model`
3. ❌ Set `vision_provider="nous"`, `vision_model="claude-sonnet-4.5"`
4. ❌ Set `vision_provider="opencode-go"`, `vision_model="deepseek-v4-pro"`
5. ❌ Set `vision_provider="openai"`, `vision_model="gpt-4o"`
6. ❌ Set `vision_provider="nous"`, `vision_model=""`

**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**
The error suggests the Hermes vision layer is routing through a hardcoded provider (likely OpenCode-Go) regardless of config settings. The API call itself is reaching the provider, but the model name being sent doesn't match any model in that provider's catalog.

This could be:
1. **Hermes bug**: Vision routing hardcoded to OpenCode-Go even when config specifies otherwise
2. **Provider API change**: OpenCode-Go changed their vision model names
3. **Model alias issue**: Configured model name doesn't map to provider's actual model ID

**Workaround:**
**Workaround:** When vision is unavailable, ask user to describe the content manually or provide text transcription.

### Z.AI Token Expiry and Subscription Scope Confusion

**Symptom:**
- 401 error: "令牌已过期或验证不正确" (token expired or invalid)
- 1113 error: "余额不足或无可用资源包" (insufficient balance or no resource package)
- Fresh account showing 0% usage quotas but getting "Insufficient balance" errors

**CRITICAL: Env Var Name Matters**

The `.env` file MUST use `ZAI_API_KEY` (not `GLM_API_KEY`):

```bash
# .env - CORRECT
ZAI_API_KEY=REDACTED-GLM_API_KEY

# .env - WRONG (config.yaml references ${ZAI_API_KEY}, won't find this)
GLM_API_KEY=REDACTED-GLM_API_KEY
```

**Renewal Pattern:**
1. User gets new token from https://open.bigmodel.cn/
2. Agent adds to `.env` as `ZAI_API_KEY=...`
3. Agent verifies direct API access with `curl` test
4. User restarts gateway from separate shell (agent can't do this)

**For complete token renewal workflow, see:** `references/zai-token-renewal-workflow.md`

**Root Causes:**
1. **Token expired**: Z.AI tokens have expiration periods
2. **Subscription mismatch**: Token not linked to correct subscription tier
   - Example: New token points to global plan, but coding subscription has quota
   - Coding subscription tokens must be generated FOR the coding subscription project
3. **Subscription scope confusion** (CRITICAL):
   - **"GLM Coding Plan"** covers web tools (web search, reader, Zread), NOT GLM API inference
   - Quotas shown in browser (5 hours, weekly, monthly) are for web tool usage
   - **GLM model API calls are a separate resource package**
   - This creates UX confusion: "GLM Coding Plan" sounds like it includes GLM models, but doesn't

**The Free GLM-4.7-Flash Exception:**

Z.AI offers **GLM-4.7-Flash as permanently free** via their API. This is a strategic choice:
- Fully open weights on HuggingFace — anyone can run locally
- Permanently free API access — market penetration strategy
- "42x cheaper than Claude" positioning

**Why GLM-4.7-Flash is free:**
- Open-source community model strategy
- Gets developers hooked on Z.AI's platform
- Competes with GPT-4-mini by being free

**Practical implication:**
- If your Z.AI subscription doesn't cover paid GLM models (glm-4.7, glm-5.2, etc.), use **glm-4.7-flash** for free
- Same 200K context, similar quality, zero cost
- Only difference is slightly faster responses vs base GLM-4.7

**For detailed deployment guidance, see:** `references/glm-flash-free-access.md`

**Local deployment considerations:**
- **GLM-4.7-Flash requires 19-60GB** depending on quantization
- **q4_K_M (4-bit):** 19GB model, ~22GB RAM needed
- **q8_0 (8-bit):** 32GB model, ~35GB RAM needed
- **bf16 (full):** 60GB model, ~64GB RAM needed
- **VPS constraint:** Current VPS has 11GB RAM available → not practical
- **Use free API instead:** Same quality, faster, no hardware cost

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Test token validity
curl -s -X POST "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "glm-4.7", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test"}], "max_tokens": 10}'
```

- **401**: Token expired → regenerate
- **1113**: Token valid but wrong subscription → regen from correct project

**Resolution:**
1. Go to Z.AI dashboard
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Select the **coding subscription project** (not global)
4. Generate new token specifically for that project
5. Ensure proxy URL points to coding subscription endpoint
6. Update Hermes config:
```bash
hermes config set zai.api_key <new_token>
hermes config set zai.proxy_url <coding-proxy-url>
```

**Prevention:**
- Track token expiry dates (documented in memory)
- Note which subscription tier each token is tied to
- Always generate tokens from the specific project/subscription, not global

## Configuration Update Pattern

```bash
# Safe model update
sed -i 's/default: glm-4.5-flash/default: glm-4.7/' ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml

# Verify change
grep "default:" ${PROFILE_DIR}/config.yaml

# Test model availability
curl -s "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models" | jq -r '.data[].id' | grep "z-ai/glm-4.7"
```

## Cron Job Model Drift Protection

**Discovery (Jul 5, 2026):** Cron jobs with unpinned model configurations fail when global inference config drifts.

**Error Pattern:**
```
RuntimeError: Skipped to prevent unintended spend: global inference config drifted since this job was created (provider 'zai' -> 'nous'; model 'glm-4.7' -> 'deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash'), and this job is unpinned.
```

**Root Cause:** Hermes safety feature prevents unpinned jobs from running on different model to prevent unexpected spend when global config changes. The global config at creation time is "baked in" — when global config changes, drift detection blocks execution.

**CRITICAL: `cronjob action=update` Is NOT a CLI Command**

The `cronjob` function is a Python-level Hermes agent tool, NOT a standalone CLI command. In agent sessions, `cronjob action=update` may not be available. `hermes cron edit` also does NOT support `--model` or `--provider` flags.

**The actual working approach for bulk provider switches:** edit `~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/cron/jobs.json` directly. See `references/cron-jobs-bulk-provider-switch.md` for the complete batch pattern with Python JSON manipulation and verification.

### Bulk Provider Switch — Direct jobs.json Edit

```python
import json

with open('${PROFILE_DIR}/cron/jobs.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

target_ids = ['job-id-1', 'job-id-2', ...]  # List of job IDs to update

for job in data['jobs']:
    if job['id'] in target_ids:
        job['provider'] = 'new-provider'
        if job.get('model') and 'deepseek-v4-flash' in job['model']:
            job['model'] = 'deepseek-v4-flash'  # Normalize

with open('${PROFILE_DIR}/cron/jobs.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Read back and check provider/model for each target job
python3 -c "
import json
with open('${PROFILE_DIR}/cron/jobs.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
for j in data['jobs']:
    if j['id'] in ['target-ids']:
        ok = j.get('provider') == 'expected-provider'
        print(f\"{'✅' if ok else '❌'} {j['id'][:12]} prov={j.get('provider')}\")
"
```

**No restart needed** — the Hermes gateway reads `jobs.json` on each tick and picks up changes automatically.

**CRITICAL: Exclude no-agent script jobs.** Jobs with `no_agent: true` don't use an LLM — changing their provider/model is unnecessary and creates confusion. Always verify after a switch that no-agent jobs were not accidentally modified. See `references/cron-jobs-bulk-provider-switch.md` for the full verification pattern including how to identify and exclude no-agent jobs.

**Why This Happens:**
- Global model config changes (e.g., switching providers)
- Cron jobs created with old global baked-in config
- Hermes blocks execution to prevent unintended cost spikes on wrong model

**Prevention:**
- Always specify `provider` and `model` when creating cron jobs
- Pin models explicitly, never rely on global defaults
- When switching providers, batch-update all jobs immediately via jobs.json
- Monitor cron job status for drift errors (`last_status: error`)
- **One-shot jobs are CONSUMED even when drift-skipped** (Sep 2, 2026): a finite one-shot job that gets blocked by drift detection is still burned — "This finite one-shot job is consumed by this attempted run." You cannot re-run it after pinning config. The only path is to create a NEW one-shot with explicit `--provider`/`--model` from the start. This applies to reminder/deadline one-shots too — treat one-shot + unpinned as a live grenade whenever a provider switch is in flight.

**Example from Provider Switch (Jul 9, 2026):**
- Old: Various jobs on `zai/glm-4.7`, `zai/glm-5`, `zai/glm-5.2`
- Drift: Global config changed to `nous/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
- Fix: Updated all 30 active + paused cron jobs to `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` / `nous`
- Includes no_agent jobs (drift detection blocks them too)
- Paused jobs also need updating if they'll be resumed later

## Diagnosing "Provider Failed After Retries" / Gateway-Connected-But-Agent-Fails (Jul 30, 2026)

**Symptom:** Telegram gateway shows `connected` and receives messages, but every reply dies with "unexpected error" or "The model provider failed after retries." This is NOT a transport failure — the agent's model call is failing. Gateway health ≠ agent health.

**Fast diagnostic (on the gateway host):**
```bash
# 1. Find the provider/base_url the agent actually tried + the error type
journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway-<profile>.service --since "10 min ago" \
  | grep -iE "APIConnectionError|provider failed|after retries|base_url=" | tail -20

# 2. Confirm which host resolves (inference endpoint returns 200; portal returns 000)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "inference-api -> HTTP %{http_code}\n" --max-time 8 https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer x"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "portal -> HTTP %{http_code}\n" --max-time 8 https://api.nousresearch.com/
```

**Root cause pattern:** agent logs `base_url=https://api.nousresearch.com` with `error_type=APIConnectionError` → `providers.<name>.base_url` points at a dead/OAuth-only host. Fix:
```bash
hermes config set providers.nous.base_url "https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1"
hermes gateway restart
```
Verify: the inference host returns HTTP 200; the portal host returns 000 (cannot resolve). Then send a test chat message — the agent should answer.

**Transient "No LLM provider configured" — don't over-rotate:** a `RuntimeError: No LLM provider configured` on the FIRST message right after a restart is often a config-read race in the agent subprocess. A second clean `hermes gateway restart` clears it; only escalate to the `base_url` fix above if it persists on subsequent messages.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Weekly Catalog Checks**: Verify configured models exist
2. **Model Performance Tracking**: Monitor cost/performance tradeoffs
3. **Provider Health**: Monitor provider API availability
4. **Fallback Logging**: Track fallback usage for optimization
5. **Cron Job Drift Monitoring**: Check for unpinned cron jobs that may fail on global config changes

## Integration Points

- **gentech-ops**: Include in system health checks
- **agent-economy**: Ensure model availability for agent services
- **cron-session-fresh-start**: Validate model config on session start

## Switching to Free NVIDIA Nemotron Models on Ollama Cloud (Sep 2026)

**Discovery:** NVIDIA provides free models (Nemotron 3 Super, Nemotron Ultra) on Ollama Cloud at zero incremental cost on the free tier. These can be used as the DEV model in the develop-and-verify pipeline, with a separate auditor model (e.g., Kimi K2.7) incurring its normal cost.

### Verification Steps
1. Confirm model responds correctly on your Ollama-Cloud key:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_API_KEY=$(grep -oP '^OLLAMA_API_KEY=\K.*' /path/to/.env)
   curl -s -X POST https://ollama.com/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLLAMA_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"nemotron-3-super","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with the single word: alive"}],"max_tokens":8}'
   ```
   Expected: HTTP 200 + valid completion JSON containing the word "alive".

2. Update the model.default in each agent profile's config.yaml:
   ```bash
   hermes config set model.default nemotron-3-super --profile <profile>
   ```
   (Repeat for gentech, gizmo, pixel, gentech-treasury)

3. Pin affected cron jobs to prevent fail-closed on provider/model drift:
   ```bash
   hermes cron edit <job_id> --provider ollama-cloud --model nemotron-3-super
   ```
   (Do this for any cron job that performs dev/model tasks; audit jobs may keep the auditor model.)

4. Verify no OpenRouter or other provider references remain in config that could cause fallthrough.

### Cost Impact
- DEV phase: ~$0 per run (free on Ollama Cloud)
- AUDIT phase: unchanged (e.g., Kimi K2.7 ≈ $2 per 1M tokens)
- Overall per-run cost drops dramatically while preserving two-phase verification.

### Pitfalls
- Do not assume the model exists in the catalog; always verify with a live API call.
- When switching providers, remember to update auxiliary models (web_extract, compression, etc.) if they are used in dev tasks.
- The `hermes config set` command does not unpinned cron jobs; you must explicitly pin them to avoid drift errors.


## Provider Fallthrough Prevention (Jul 8, 2026)

**Problem:** Telegram gateway auto-switching providers and models to OpenRouter despite explicit `model.provider: nous` config.

**Root Cause:** Config entropy — multiple competing defaults cause fallthrough chains that land on unintended providers.

### Config Entropy Sources

There are FOUR distinct places a provider/model can be set in the config, and they compete:

```yaml
# 1. Primary model block (authoritative — set via hermes config set model.*)
model:
  default: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
  provider: nous

# 2. Flat 'default:' key (set by flat hermes config set default.*)
default:
  model: deepseek-v4-flash       # ← DIFFERENT provider than #1
  provider: opencode-go

# 3. fallback_providers block (set by hermes config set fallback_providers)
fallback_providers:
  - provider: opencode-go
    model: deepseek-v4-flash

# 4. Legacy flat 'fallback_providers[0]:' key
fallback_providers[0]:
  model: deepseek-v4-flash        # ← Stale duplicate, no provider name
```

**When #1 fails** (OAuth glitch, rate limit, connection timeout), Hermes falls through:
```
#1 (nous) → fails → #2 (opencode-go, empty key) → fails → #3 (opencode-go... same empty) → 
ClawRouter plugin auto-routes → OpenRouter
```

**Result:** The user sees Telegram mysteriously using OpenRouter despite the config saying `nous`.

### Diagnostics: Finding Config Entropy

```bash
# Find all competing default entries
grep -n "^model:\|^default:\|^fallback_providers\|^  provider:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Check for stale flat entries (these should NOT exist at root level)
grep -n "^default:\|^fallback_providers\[0\]:\|^opencode-go:\|^nvidia:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Check for custom_providers (stale third-party hijack risk)
grep -A 4 "^custom_providers:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Check plugins for ClawRouter
grep -A 2 "plugins:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Check for OpenRouter references in active config
grep -i "openrouter" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml
```

### Cleanup Procedure

**Step 1: Remove stale flat config entries**

These are created by `hermes config set` applying flat keys instead of nested ones. They conflict with the real `model:` block:

```bash
# Remove flat 'default:' block (competes with 'model:' block)
sed -i '/^default:$/,/^[a-zA-Z]/{/^default:$/d; /^  model:/d; /^  provider:/d}' ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Remove flat fallback_providers[N] legacy blocks
sed -i '/^fallback_providers\[[0-9]\]:$/,/^[a-zA-Z]/{/^fallback_providers\[[0-9]\]:/d; /^  model:/d}' ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Remove flat empty provider blocks (opencode-go, nvidia, etc. at root level)
sed -i '/^opencode-go:$/,/^[a-zA-Z]/{/^opencode-go:$/d; /^  api_key:/d; /^  base_url:/d}' ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml
```

**Step 2: Remove stale custom_providers block**

The `custom_providers` section often contains old third-party endpoints with hardcoded API keys (e.g. mimo-v2.5). This is both a security risk and a routing hijack vector:

```bash
sed -i '/^custom_providers:/,/^[a-z]/{/^custom_providers:/d; /^  - api_key:/d; /^    base_url:/d; /^    model:/d; /^    name:/d}' ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml
```

**Step 3: Disable ClawRouter plugin**

ClawRouter-Hermes auto-routes providers without respecting the explicit `model.provider` config. If you have it enabled, `model.provider: nous` is advisory, not enforced:

```bash
hermes config set plugins.enabled "[kapso, gentech-session-startup]"
```

**Step 4: Set explicit fallback_model (NOT OpenRouter, NOT dead models)**

Without `fallback_model`, Hermes falls through to whatever it can find — often OpenRouter via auto-discovery or ClawRouter. Pin it to the same provider and a model that actually exists:

```bash
hermes config set fallback_model.provider "nous"
hermes config set fallback_model.model "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"
```

**⚠️ Do NOT use stale model names.** `claude-3.5-sonnet` has been deprecated on Nous Portal and causes `HTTP 404` on every fallback attempt. Always verify the fallback model actually exists on the provider before setting it.

**Step 5: Pin the primary model**

Ensure the `model:` block is explicit, not relying on defaults:

```bash
hermes config set model.default "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"
hermes config set model.provider "nous"
hermes config set model.base_url "https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1"
```

### Verification

After cleanup:

```bash
# Confirm model is pinned correctly
hermes config show | grep -A 3 "Model:"

# Confirm fallback stays on your provider
grep -A 2 "fallback_model:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml

# Confirm NO stale entries remain
grep -n "^default:\|^fallback_providers\[0\]:\|^opencode-go:\|^custom_providers:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml || echo "Clean ✓"

# Confirm NO OpenRouter in active config
grep -i "openrouter" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml || echo "No OpenRouter references ✓"

# Confirm ClawRouter is removed from plugins
grep -A 2 "plugins:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml
```

### Pitfalls

- **Do NOT assume `hermes config set model.*` is sufficient** — flat `default:` entries from earlier `hermes config set default.*` commands silently override the primary model block when the provider field differs
- **ClawRouter is the most common cause of "mysterious provider switching"** — it's a plugin that auto-routes. Disable it when you want explicit provider control, not routing
- **`custom_providers` entries persist indefinitely** — they're created by old `hermes setup` runs and never cleaned up. They can cause routing to dead endpoints years after the setup that created them
- **After cleaning up stale entries, always restart the gateway** — the gateway caches config at startup and doesn't pick up changes at runtime:
  ```bash
  hermes gateway restart --profile gentech
  ```
- **`fallback_model` with a dead model causes ALL cron jobs to fail** — When `fallback_model.model` references a deprecated model (e.g. `claude-3.5-sonnet` dropped by Nous Portal), any provider stutter kicks the fallback chain into a dead endpoint. Every cron job then fails with `HTTP 404: Model '...' not found`. Fix: `hermes config set fallback_model.model "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"`. Verify with `grep -A 2 "fallback_model:" ~/.hermes/profiles/gentech/config.yaml`.
- **`patch()` tool blocked on Hermes config files** — The security guard blocks agent edits to `config.yaml`. Trying to fix `fallback_model` via `patch()` fails with "Refusing to write to Hermes config file". Always use `hermes config set fallback_model.model "model-name"` instead. This applies to all Hermes config editing — never use `patch()` or `sed` on config.yaml.

## Provider Failure Classes & Fleet-Wide Aux Sweep (Aug 29, 2026)

Four DISTINCT failure classes all look like "model unavailable" — diagnose before mass re-pinning:

| Class | Signature | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Region block** | HTTP 403 `RegionError` — "model only available hosted in China, requires explicit opt in" | Only the account owner can opt in at the provider workspace URL in the error. Treat model as dead fleet-wide until then (happened to deepseek-v4-flash/pro on OpenCode Go) |
| **Billing lapse** | HTTP 403 "subscription payment is past due" | Config can't fix this. Verify payment status with a curl test BEFORE re-pinning the fleet onto the provider |
| **Quota/balance** | 429 or 1113-style "insufficient balance" | Wait, downgrade tier, or switch provider |
| **Client-signature block** | urllib/Python clients get Cloudflare 403 error code 1010; **curl gets the REAL error JSON** | Always probe providers with `curl`, never urllib — urllib's 403-1010 masks the actual RegionError and wastes diagnosis time |

**Vision capability must be live-tested per model before pinning `auxiliary.vision`:**
```bash
# Generate a tiny solid-color PNG, base64 data-URL it, POST via chat/completions
# with a [{'type':'text'},{'type':'image_url'}] content array.
# PASS = HTTP 200 + color name in choices[0].message.content.
# Gotcha: max_tokens must be >=64 — reasoning models spend tokens thinking and
# return EMPTY content if max_tokens is too small (looks like a vision failure).
```
Confirmed vision-capable on OpenCode Go (Aug 29): `glm-5.3-flash`. NOT `glm-5.2` (400 on image input).

**Auxiliary slots live per-profile in config.yaml under `auxiliary.<slot>.{provider,model}`** — jobs.json re-pins do NOT touch them, and the old flat-key pattern (`web_extract_model ...`) is superseded. The verified sweep (all slots: web_extract, compression, skills_hub, approval, mcp, triage_specifier, curator, session_search, vision):
```bash
for s in web_extract compression skills_hub approval mcp triage_specifier curator session_search; do
  hermes config set --profile $P auxiliary.$s.provider <provider>
  hermes config set --profile $P auxiliary.$s.model <model>
done
hermes config set --profile $P auxiliary.vision.provider <provider>   # only if vision-tested
hermes config set --profile $P auxiliary.vision.model <model>
```
Also check `providers.<router>.models` lists (e.g. clawrouter menus) for stale blocked models — they persist as selectable routes long after the model dies.

**List-valued config keys:** `fallback_providers` is a LIST — dot notation can't address elements (`fallback_providers.model` fails). Set the whole list as JSON via `hermes config set --force fallback_providers '[{...},{...}]'`.

**Automation:** `scripts/cron-provider-sync.py` v2 (in gentech profile) does all of this fleet-wide in one run — crons + aux + fallback chains across all 4 profiles, idempotent, with a VISION_CAPABLE guard. Companion details in the `cron-model-routing` skill.

## Fleet-Wide Provider Alignment Runbook (Aug 30, 2026)

When the order is "get everybody on the same model/provider" (all profiles: gentech, gizmo, pixel, gentech-treasury), verified end-to-end:

**Known-good combo — "GLM on Ollama Cloud" (live-verified, runs the Chair's own session):**
```yaml
model:
  default: glm-5.3-flash        # Z.AI GLM-5.3 Flash served by Ollama Cloud
  provider: opencode-go          # provider NAME only — explicit base_url overrides where traffic goes
  base_url: https://ollama.com/v1
```
The provider label can stay `opencode-go` while `model.base_url` points at Ollama Cloud — the explicit base_url wins at runtime. Do NOT assume provider name == traffic destination, and don't "fix" it to a name that matches; replicate the proven combo exactly.

**Steps (per profile):**
1. Read current state: `hermes --profile <P> config get model.provider`
2. **Live-test the rail BEFORE flipping anyone:**
```bash
KEY=$(grep '^OLLAMA_API_KEY=' ${PROFILE_DIR}/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
curl -s --max-time 30 -X POST https://ollama.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -d '{"model":"glm-5.3-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"reply OK"}],"max_tokens":8}'
```
3. Set per profile: `hermes --profile <P> config set model.default glm-5.3-flash` → `model.provider opencode-go` → `model.base_url https://ollama.com/v1`
4. Verify ALL profiles in one loop (default/provider/base_url identical)
5. Key presence: every profile's `.env` must contain the keys the provider block interpolates (`OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` + `OLLAMA_API_KEY`)

**⚠️ PITFALL — `HERMES_PROFILE=<name> hermes config set ...` does NOT target that profile.** Reads and writes silently go to the CALLING profile (verified: three HERMES_PROFILE-prefixed sets all wrote gentech's config while claiming success). Only the `--profile` CLI flag targets another profile: `hermes --profile gizmo config get model.provider`. Always re-verify with `--profile` gets after any cross-profile set.

**⚠️ Unpinned-cron warning on provider change (new format Aug 30):** Hermes prints `⚠️ N enabled unpinned cron jobs have stored provider_snapshot values that differ from the new global provider. They will fail closed on their next run`. Pin them: `hermes cron edit <job_id> --provider <provider> --model <model>` — **cron edit DOES support these flags now** (supersedes the Jul 5 note below).

## Sep 2 Fleet Migration — Verified Refinements (2026-09-02)

Full 4-profile migration to `glm-5.3-flash` on Ollama Cloud (nemotron-3-super demoted to backup-only) verified end-to-end. Three refinements to the runbook above:

**1. Reasoning-model live-test gotcha — max_tokens 64 is NOT enough.** glm-5.3-flash on Ollama Cloud returned HTTP 200 with EMPTY `content` and `finish_reason: length` at max_tokens=8 AND max_tokens=64 — the reasoning budget consumed them all. Only at max_tokens=512 did content return (`'OK'`). This applies to plain-text tests too, not just vision. Live-test reasoning models with `max_tokens >= 512`, and check `choices[0].message.reasoning` (or `reasoning_content`) to distinguish "model is thinking past the cap" from "model returned nothing". Cron prompts already use generous max_tokens, so this bites only quick curl probes.

**2. Gateway restart scope after a model switch — do NOT over-restart.** Verified Sep 2: cron jobs pick up `jobs.json` edits on the NEXT TICK (no restart), and cron/agent sessions read config fresh at spawn — so a fleet model flip needs NO gateway restart at all for cron behavior. Gateway restart is only needed for an already-running interactive gateway session to see new config. And the restart itself is ALWAYS guard-blocked from inside a gateway-hosted agent session (`systemctl restart hermes-gateway-*`, even via terminal background=true, is refused: "gateway would kill this command"). Restart must come from a separate shell outside the gateway (user action or a cron session on another host). If an interactive session acts stale after a config flip, a fresh session picks up config — try that before any restart.

**3. Fleet straggler sweep pattern (full session record: `references/fleet-migration-2026-09-02.md`).** One execute_code pass scans ALL profiles' jobs.json, classifies enabled LLM vs no_agent jobs, and surfaces stragglers still on the old model; per-profile batch re-pin then read-back verify. Sep 2 sweep found 4 nemotron stragglers hiding among 39 glm jobs in gentech while the other 3 profiles were already clean — you cannot assume uniformity from a global config change; jobs keep their baked-in pins until individually re-pinned.

## Fleet Model Sync — Run It After Every HQ Switch (Sep 7, 2026)

**Discovery:** Switching HQ (`gentech`) to a new provider/model does NOT propagate to the other profiles automatically. `fleet_model_sync.py` exists at `00-System/agent-profiles/` but is a MANUAL tool — it must be run after every daily-driver change. In this session, HQ moved to `deepseek-v4-flash:0731`/`ollama-cloud` but treasury, gizmo, and pixel stayed on `nous`/`upstage/solar-pro4:free` because the sync was never invoked. Jordan flagged it: "Treasury group is not using the same stack as us."

**The fix (verified):**
```bash
cd ${VAULT_DIR}/00-System/agent-profiles
python3 fleet_model_sync.py --check   # dry-run: shows which profiles DRIFT
python3 fleet_model_sync.py           # sync gentech's settings to all profiles + repin crons
```

**Two-pass cron repin is REQUIRED.** The default `--dead-providers opencode` only repins jobs pinned to opencode. If the fleet is coming OFF nous (or any other provider), run a SECOND pass targeting that provider:
```bash
python3 fleet_model_sync.py --dead-providers nous
```

**Pitfall — stale `base_url` blocks cron repin (verified Sep 7):** jobs that carry an explicit `base_url` field pointing at the OLD provider fail `hermes cron edit --provider <new> --model <new>` with:
```
Failed to update job: base_url 'https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1' is not allowed for provider 'ollama-cloud'. A named provider's stored credential may only be sent to its own endpoint...
```
The `--dead-providers` pass reports "cron repinned: N" but silently skips these. Fix: clear the stale `base_url` from the job in `jobs.json` (pop the key), then re-run the repin. Verify with a read-back that counts enabled jobs per provider — do NOT trust the sync's own "repinned" count.

**Pitfall — configs fixed on disk ≠ running gateways.** Gateways snapshot config at process start. After a fleet model sync, the running gateways still serve the OLD provider until restarted. Check `systemctl --user show hermes-gateway-<p>.service -p ExecMainStartTimestamp` — if it predates the sync, the gateway is stale. Restart via `fleet_update.py --restart-only` (see `safe-update-restart` skill; your own session drops mid-run, that's expected).

## Ollama Cloud Config Restore After Billing Renewal (Sep 6, 2026)

**Reference:** `references/ollama-cloud-restore-2026-09-06.md` — full session record, text-level patching technique, and pitfalls (yaml.dump round-trip reordering, `patch()` security guard block, `hermes config set` can't add whole provider blocks).

**Summary:** When Ollama Cloud billing lapses and the fleet comes back online after renewal, the restore is more than just flipping the primary model. The `providers.ollama-cloud` block itself can be missing (stripped during a prior provider switch), and all 8+ auxiliary slots need re-pointing. The verified restore sequence:

1. Check whether `providers.ollama-cloud` exists in config.yaml (grep). If missing, it must be added as a full block — not just the primary model flip.
2. Set primary: `model.default=glm-5.3-flash`, `model.provider=ollama-cloud`, `model.base_url=https://ollama.com/v1`.
3. Re-point auxiliary slots: vision, compression, skills_hub, approval, mcp, triage_specifier, curator, web_extract → ollama-cloud / glm-5.3-flash.
4. Verify with a curl live probe against ollama.com/v1 (expect weekly-usage-limit error immediately after renewal — that's normal, key is valid).
5. `hermes config check` clean.

**Pitfall — text-level edits only for config.yaml:** yaml.safe_load → edit → yaml.dump round-trips silently reorder the `providers:` block and can merge provider entries (ollama-cloud got absorbed into clawrouter in one attempt). `patch()` is blocked by the security guard. Only raw text read/replace/write preserves the file's structure. See the reference for the exact pattern.

**Pitfall — fallback chain survives provider switches:** `fallback_providers` entries referencing ollama-cloud (gpt-oss:120b, nemotron-3-super) persist across provider changes — they're already in the file and don't need re-adding. Only the primary model block and the provider entry itself need attention.

## Ollama Cloud Pricing and Usage Model (Jul 6, 2026)

**Discovery:** Ollama Cloud uses **GPU time billing**, NOT token-based billing. This fundamentally changes cost calculations.

### Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Price | Usage | Concurrent Models | Use Cases |
|------|-------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Light usage | 1 | Chatting, evaluating models, coding with small models |
| **Pro** | $20/month ($200/yr) | Day-to-day work | 3 | Larger models, coding automation, deep research |
| **Max** | $100/month | Heavy sustained | 10 | Continuous agent tasks, multiple concurrent agents, extended sessions |

### Cost Comparison: Token-Based vs GPU-Time

**Scenario:** 50 security audits (10K output tokens each) + 500 code builds (5K output tokens each)

| Provider | Model | Pricing Model | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **ZAI (current)** | GLM 5.2 | Token-based ($0.40/$1.00 per 1M) | ~$950 |
| **Ollama Cloud** | qwen3-coder-next | GPU-time (Pro plan: $20/mo) | $20 |
| **OpenCode Go** | DeepSeek V4 Pro | Token-based (~$0.26/$0.65 per 1M) | ~$247 |

**Potential savings:** 97.9% ($930/month) with Ollama Cloud Pro plan

### Dual-Agent Concurrent Needs

Gentech + Forge architecture requires:
- Gentech: 2-3 models (audit, vision, fallback)
- Forge: 1-2 models (coding, vision)
- **Total: 3-5 concurrent models**

**Pro plan supports 3 concurrent models ✅**

### Configuration for Ollama Cloud

```yaml
providers:
  ollama-cloud:
    api_key: ${OLLAMA_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://ollama.com/v1
    type: openai_compatible

model:
  default: deepseek-v4-flash
  provider: ollama-cloud

auxiliary:
  vision:
    provider: ollama-cloud
    model: qwen2.5-vision
```

### Investigation Tasks (Forge)

1. **Check Pro plan limits:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLLAMA_API_KEY" \
     https://api.ollama.com/v1/usage
   ```

2. **Test model quality:**
   - Run audit with qwen3-coder-next
   - Compare to GLM 5.2 output

3. **Monitor GPU time usage:**
   - Measure per-audit GPU time
   - Extrapolate to monthly usage
