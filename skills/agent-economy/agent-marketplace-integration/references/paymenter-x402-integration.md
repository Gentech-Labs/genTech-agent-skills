## Market Gap

227 extensions on the marketplace. **Zero crypto gateways.** Every single one uses Stripe/PayPal.

## Our Extension

**Repo:** https://github.com/Gentech-Labs/paymenter-x402

The extension adds "Pay with Crypto (x402)" as a checkout option. When selected, it generates an x402 payment request with a QR code. On confirmation, the invoice is marked paid. Includes Q402 Trust Receipts for cryptographically signed settlement records.

### File Structure

## Revenue Model
